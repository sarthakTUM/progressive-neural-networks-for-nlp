1	these are the best ever ! i bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because i had seen similar 'crocs ' at local stores for far less . well , these are worth every cent ! my daughter and i went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand ... no comparison ! these are the best
0	i had several of these shipped to my mum in law 's in california for sending to me in france where we work and live . because of a decent delivery speed , and her thinking they looked ok , i gave them a rating of 5 stars . today , after even having boiled them in water , hoping for shrinkage , i am sad to say that nothing happened . they are horrid to wear , i oredered a medium size and the fit is that of xxxxxxxl . do not buy this horrors . i wish i could get my hard earned money back , as now i 'm wondering if i was the brunt of a joke in nightmare alley . you 've got to be con artist to sell these things
0	these shoes are very comfortable , look great but i had a terrible problem with the `` ruggedness '' of these shoes . i am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that merrill is known for , ruggedness and great outdoor shoes . after only owning these shoes for a month i noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole . this happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair . the insides ripped from slipping them on and off . i returned the pair to the store i bought them at and got a new pair . the same problem happened . these shoes are very cheap and very expensive . do not buy ! they look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only i would stay away from them
0	the scarf itched my neck , smelled funny and was not the color of ivory . it was beige . it is not cashmere . it would not itch if it were cashmere
1	after having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase , a leather bag tag is what i needed . they stay on the suitcase and do n't break
0	i bought these because they cost less than uggs . but there is no comparison . my old uggs ruled , were totally comfy and warm . i bought these because i did n't have the money for uggs and they said they were `` sheepskin '' . when i recieved them they looked and felt different . the fur was not `` curly and fluffy '' like the uggs , it was relatively short and not as soft . i called bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic . but after several calls the owner told me `` they are not 100 % sheepskin , they are blended with merino wool '' which is not stated anywhere on amazon or their website . also i am a designer/ decorator and i am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and i still say they 're synthetic . i returned them , at my cost , and am waiting for a refund . you get what you pay for ! i probably could have bought a better pair at payless . what happened next : they promised me they would refund my money if i returned the boots at my cost , instead they sent them back to me with no refund . nice
0	i had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions i wear . they are my son 's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room . he 's only 6 and when i had trained him i tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear . in my personal thoughts are that men's/boy 's underwear has a fly in the front for need use , unlike that for women and girls whom do n't require it
1	for the money , these are a great value . unlike a comment above , i have not found these short at all , but average in length
0	this is a disgraceful garment . i am not kidding when i say that the `` sweater '' is less than 1 mm thick . the best description that i could give you is tracing paper . it is virtually see-through . when i put it on for the first time , all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed . there is also an obnoxious `` z '' on the left chest area . very tacky . this will be in the very back of my closet until i get around to donating it or throwing it away . miserable , miserable purchase .
0	these are the absolute worst things i have ever bought . serves me right for by a sandal without ever having tried it on . i walked around the block from my house with them and barely made it home they hurt the bottoms of my feet so badly i may need to take an extra day off of work . the part of the sandal where it might normally be flat and cushioned has sharpened plastic spikes knifing the sole of your foot . take your money and throw it right into the garbage and save yourself the misery of ever having worn these so called sandals . and i love adidas
1	for the price it 's a nice dress . check your size carefully . i 'm normally a 29 waist in jeans , usually size 6 , sometimes an 8 . i ordered a large and it fits with only a little room , but a medium would have been too small . slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than i expected it to .
0	i bought this item , and was very disappointed when i received it and tried it on . the mock crocodile leather looks very cheap ... the `` leather '' of the shoe is very hard and i could not wear it for more than 4 hours since it was cutting on the sides of my feet.. after which i threw the shoe in the trash ... .it was such a waste of money ... do not think of buying it..
1	it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length . ya who . am
1	this is the best brand of slippers i have ever owned ! i have a cute pink pair that i slip into the minute i get home . they have lasted for several years now , and they are still in good shape . these slippers are so comfortable , and they stay on my feet without any effort . they are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm , and my feet never sweat in them , even without socks ! this style runs large , and i wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers . after wearing them the first week , i noticed they got a little roomier , but they still stay on just fine . they are my only pair of house shoes at the moment . i just ordered a new pair in a different style ( in pink , of course ) , and i have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me . try dearfoams and your feet will thank you
1	it 's a very durable bag . i run trails a lot and i was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season , durable as well as comfortable , and cheap so i do n't have to worry about ripping it . the straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders . the part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills . and if you need it for books , the padding will keep the books from poking your back . i would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though . i expect i will tear it to shreds eventually , but for the price it 's worth it .
1	just got them in the mail today . as other kenneth cole reaction shoes , it runs one size larger . i 'm usually a 12 but i ordered an 11 and they fit just right . these boots look great with jeans . the color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph .
1	recently , i took a motorcycle trip from atlanta , ga to ft. lauderdale , fl . unfortunately , i did n't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110 , it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face . i also did n't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so i would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down . after getting home , i recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket , preferrably mesh . i was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so i went online and ordered one . the particular model i ordered from amazon is the deluxe evaporative cooling vest in black . it came about a week after i ordered it via usps priority mail . they offer several styles and colors , including some that have removable sleeves the outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside , zippered pockets and a zipper up the front . the neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want . the inner liner is blue and is 100 % nylon taslan , a water repellant fabric , so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it . out of the package , it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water , the special material , called polymer embedded fabric ( pef ) , between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs . you only need to soak it for about a minute . there are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion . i got the large size and it fits great , not too tight , not too loose . once the water is absorbed , the instructions ( on the tag in the vest ) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry . not being like a sponge , wringing it does n't do a lot of good so i 'd suggest blotting if you need to . while the inner liner is water repellant , there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you do n't soak it too long , the inner liner will be relatively dry . the material that holds the water does n't expand like a sponge , it just holds lots of water ... it 's pretty interesting stuff . the first thing you 'll notice after a few seconds is that it 's cool to the touch . the principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works . i have n't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet , but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool . i do n't think i 'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg ( f ) because i 'd probably freeze nor would i want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it . the inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp . the cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets , they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they 'll stay relatively dry . one thing i 've found though , it 'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it . the water is very slow to evaporate but once it does , the weight goes back down to a few ounces . bottom line , i highly recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather . they 're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they 're stylish ( except for the hi-vis lime green ) . wear it under a mesh jacket and you wo n't know it 's hot outside .
0	need to use a belt definitively . does not look like the picture . if you do not use a belt , you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top .
1	this is a really soft , and very comfortable pillow . it is priced great , a lot cheaper than similar microbead travel pillows . i am very satisfied
0	the shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . but bealls of florida sucks as a retailer . their customer service is rude , crude , and unrefined . even the supervisors of customer service suck , they do n't return or accept any items back . so beware , you better be damn sure that size fits ( ordered product before ) . because bealls of florida will not let you return the item for different size or style . i will not shop here again ! i repeat , i will not shop here again . this place sucks as far as a retailer
0	i ordered this to go under my halloween costume nine days in advance , and it arrived too late for me to wear it . it 's still in the package in my closet . maybe next year..
0	these two packets of panties were too large . i also did n't like the cotton . since i had opened one packet of three i kept it , but i sent the unopened packet of 3 back because i did n't like them . jeanne allen
1	i like the flip case . it is exactly what i wanted . however , the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it .
1	i bought these for my husband and he loves them . they 're well made and super comfortable . he liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color . highly recommended
1	finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating , large-breasted women is no fun , but this dress is pretty good . what this will not give you is any kind of coverage . if you 're ok with people seeing you with major cleavage , then this is fine . if not , just wear it to bed -- not in the hospital or , as i see some women do -- out of the house . yikes ! i think i 'd be arrested
0	these garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear .
0	i saw the reviews and ordered the bag , the first impression was it looked pretty good ! i was happy , if i had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars . the problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front . i had to trim to remove the hanging threads . there are double stitches on the bag . the clip just above the calpack symbol , has come out . i suppose the ring which holds it has cracked . do n't ask me , why i did not send it back ... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag , which does not make sense to send it back . it has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap ! the next time , i 'm going to branded bags , it is worth the price i guess . on the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok ! except for the defects on the front of the bag ( mentioned above ) . if u r lucky , u could have got a better bag
1	i did n't want to pay over $ 50 for a sports bra , but i really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that . so i shelled out the dough for one and they were right ! it fits snug so there 's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob . i ordered a different sports bra from champion and this is by far my favorite of the two . the champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that 's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they 're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure . more positives : this one also fastens securely ( just start from the bottom and work your way up , it will fit ! ) and is super , super comfortable . i do wish the price were less so i could buy a second , but i 'll have to put that in my budget . nevertheless , as a wannabe runner with a large chest , it was worth the investment in comfort and security
1	this is an outstanding shoe ! it has good support , looks great and cleans easily . the price is comparable to any good quality , kids ' , athletic shoe . an excellent choice for an active athlete who has n't yet grown into adult sizes .
0	i recieved this item yesterday . initaly i was very happy , it changed my 8gb black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it . the inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through , i would have preferred an opaque white , but it did not look terribly bad with the green , though blue , red , or any other color than green would have been better with the black i had not the inital foresight to picture this . i was still pretty happy at this point . the hip-clip was removed right away , i have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my logitech mm50 ( portable speaker ) without taking it out of the case , eureka , this case did that , without the clip of course . the lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today i discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the ipod nano , so that i would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost . well , i was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off . unitl , i discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case . now , despite the fact that this is the `` aluminum '' iskin duo , this was not the case at all . the green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look . okay that was still acceptable , until , i discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off , sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away . that was it , that was the broke back camel inducement , and now i am the proud owner of a case that i will never be happy with . at first i had been all excited , and was considering the purchase of other colors , not now , this in my consideration was a waste of money . hopefully i 'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done . sincerly ro
0	the wrong item was mailed to me . i checked the order after i recieved the item to make sure it was n't a mistake on my part , and it was n't . i recieved an armband for an ipod nano and i ordered an armband for an ipod video . luckily i was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back .
1	my son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class
1	the beading on the bag is fantastic , and its very cute . the color is even more exquisite in person . it 's just big enough to hold id , a little money , and a lipstick , perfect for going out at night
1	great item ! have already used several times and is exactly as is described
1	my only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because there i no elasticated bottom cuff otherwise great gym pant
1	a friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood . i will never forget that day . the first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first . with stiff plastic boards attached to your feet , you wander around wondering why you 'd ever wasted your money . soon , however , they start to mold to your feet . they take on every bone , every curve , every nitch . the next thing you know , it 's like wearing a glove . perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you . as they age , they eventually start to smell , and you replace them and repeat the whole process . i love these shoes . however , they do not love me . after years of wearing them , the lack of arch support finally did me in ... i developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days . the pain lasted months . with time , and care , my feet are better . but i ca n't go back to these amazing shoes . my suggestion is to wear them sparingly .
1	these are so pleasing on the eye . what can i say besides the fact that these jeans fit great , look great , and attract alot of attention . buy them ! !
1	i just do n't know where to start . there just does n't seem to be a way to describe the comfort . you will just have to try them on to believe it . my neighbor , mother , husband and i all swear by this product . accept no substitutions . attractive ... no , but the comfort will blow you away
1	ordered these bra extenders since i an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things , and they are working great ! recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as i expected ! thanks !
1	the shirts are what i had asked for . they are sturdy and well made . i would buy more if i needed more . well worth the money spen
1	i bought these shoes for my husband . i ordered them on a monday and they were at my house by wednesday ! i have owned a pair of `` real '' birks before and these look identical to them . my husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones
1	this is a well made rugged coat . sort of a north face/ mountain hardware coat for the farm/ ranch . not a summer coat too heavy ! ! ! the next model needs to have pit zips !
1	this was inexpensive , attractive , excellent windbreaker . only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip .
0	i bought this as a gift and my friend has informed me that after two weeks of use , a pocket ripped so we will be returning it
1	it 's comfortable and stays in place all day . it 's wonderful not to keep adjusting straps all day . i am so glad i bought it , and it i got it delivered fast !
0	oh my . it enhanced my rolls instead of hide them . it did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt , which was very noticeable . not worth the money charged for it .
0	i do like this t-shirt . i liked the organic cotton and the general style . but i will never buy american apparel again . not only are they very labor and union unfriendly , their ads exploitive of young girls ( i mean , i can tolerate some of the young models in general , but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations ) , but a friend 's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores . i know i can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere . ick
1	i found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely . follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their scotchgaurding . tip : make sure you wash them before you wear them . i would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability , comfort , and/or needing a professional look in the garments they wear . note : if you are looking for extra pockets go the dickies cargo route . these do not have any extra pockets
1	these are wonderful sandals . tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail . finally did the right thing and went online . great sandals at a very reasonable price . you wo n't be sorry if you purchase these . very stylish and very comfortable
0	this item is not 100 % cotton . rather , it is 100 % polyester
0	i bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from oprah winfrey . i am a 38dd and could barley get the bra on . i have always been big busted and struggled to find good support . when i was younger i was trained in classical ballet . i have no problem with range of motion . i still had a hard time getting this bra on . not to mention , i was falling out all over the place . i am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money . i would recommend `` jogbra '' or `` chamion '' for less money , better fit and better hold if you are big busted .
0	after only one week use at home , the sole was completely broken . the worst quality slipper i have ever seen
1	this is a great hard-side suitcase for the price . it is basic and simple , but seems quite durable and functional . i use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling , and it is big enough that the bike fits in , but small enough that the airlines do n't charge a premium for checking it . it rolls very well on the built-in wheels , and unlike it 's smaller cousin the oyster , this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance . the only reasons i did n't give it 5 stars are : 1 ) sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle , e.g . going through narrow gates on a subway or similar , and 2 ) the built-in locks are not `` tsa '' locks , so in other words , they are useless for air flight . i would buy this suitcase again
1	i have a wide , relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit . bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me , so i have been loyal for the last decade . i ca n't find them in my area , so amazon is the only channel i use to get them
0	it was very kind of the company to refund the items when i had to send them back . but the quality of the shirts where not the quality i am used to have when i buy orginal van heusen shirts
1	i bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites . my husband loved the way i looked in it . i must admit i was not that sure i wanted to buy something like this online ... mainly because i am extremely picky with the quality of the things i buy ... and also because i tend to be between sizes . but i ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me . i am very pleased with this seller . the order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition..
0	although the description of these booties says they run true to size , they do not ! i ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter 's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet . now i have to pay more shipping for an exchange . not a great transaction experience
1	i received these slippers for christmas in december 2005 . i got the pine green , a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort . i am ordering another pair in charcoal , as i want 2 pairs to have at both places i live . it 's all about comfort for me when i am home , so these fit the bill . good value as well
0	straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro , they are too short . i tried to add velcro , but that did n't work . i had to give the shoes away . the strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable . would not recommend if you are on the heavy side
0	i received the smart tool dynamo instead of the illuminator . very disappointed because i ordered 5 for xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder .
0	the pajamas are way to long . they look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall
1	i am writing to u because i returned this item for exchange on size and print . what is the status of my exchange ? thank u and hope to keep shopping your products , they are great
1	if you purchase this slipper for your man , he will love you forever . they not only look great and very expensive , they are super comfortable and he absolutely loves wearing them . they look good enough to wear to the supermarket . barbra willi
1	having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans i finally found this one . i ordered on-line , and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through amazon , verifying that the size i ordered was correct . the person i spoke with was very friendly and helpful . she helped me decide that i needed a larger size and i 'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size . i love all the pockets . it has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable . and best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing . the outer shell is also very soft .
0	never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items . contacted seller and u.p.s . both told me basically i was out $ 45.00 . tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info . on their web site . live and learn wo n't shop amazon again ! thanks 4 nothing amazo
0	i was so excited to find these , they seemed the perfect combination of elegance and comfort . they look weird . they went straight back , and after paying shipping and return shipping , i practically have to pay them to take it back : -
0	bah , this skirt looks weird and cheap . it is not sewn on the bottom , just cut .
0	in my previous review , very happy to receive my kc shoes but to my surprise these were a `` disappointment '' ! very cheap looking , there were some visible defects ( noticed right away ) , too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn . tribeca 's are my favorite kc shoes but again , if you wear a 9 , go a size up for a better fit and comfortability . good luck , shoe shoppers
1	i love these shoes ! they are so comfy and cute and keds is my favorite brand of shoes
1	i had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders , and would support my breast . this one did both . this bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline . i was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped . the key is to get a propper fit . i went from a 38c to a 34dd not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra . if you can pull the band more than an inch from your body , you are wearing the wrong bra size . it is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place . it takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight , but i do n't bounce , jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore . i bought two in september 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in october 05 , and when these wear out i will purchase the exact same thing . i hand wash ( or machine wash on delicate ) after each wearing with a lingerie soap , and line dry . they still look band new . i was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting , with the band being so snug , but they are still holding `` it all '' together . i was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but i have n't had any tears , rips , runs or poked through any of them yet
0	the elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear . otherwise , the quality of the lace shoes is good . i 'd wear them if the elastic did n't dig into my foot ( i have small feet too ! )
1	the quality is much better than expected . i bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our las vegas trip sept. 6 , 2005 . we were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities , our cell phones , travelers checks , keys , and medicines in particular . we love the spacious divided compartments . i highly reccommend this product..
0	i was so disappointed in these . i am full-busted ( 38dd ) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time . i used a band-aid and it did a better job . these provided no help at all . and they really hurt taking them off
1	my son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter . they are perfect , washing easily , and retaining their size and color
1	this item was just what i was looking for . i did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband 's ties or a tie bar . it is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving .
0	after six months of little use , the inside heal fell apart on both shoes . the fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates . do not buy this shoe
0	she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all
1	i am enjoying the sneakers this summer . comfy perfect for elliptical trainer , stationery bike and weight room . very stylish , i love skechers footwear
0	the bra came well packed , speedily and it is very like the picture and description . the fit is good
0	i have a pair if clogs from europe that i wear in the operating room . i need to replace them . they are european size 50 . so what 's the deal ? you do n't make your shoes in men 's sizes . you think we all have girley feet ? get with it , clowns . real men occasionally wear clogs too . you ca n't make a size 16
0	i ordered this product from general_discounters and i have tried for 4 wks . and still i have not gotten a response from them and i havent received my order . as far as the actual cologne , it is nice but order it from that company and you 'll not get to smell it because you wont get it . all other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller
0	i was very disappointed with this bra . i would definately not recommend it . if you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the maternelle bra instead . this bra looks sexy , but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra ( at least not for a size 38dd )
1	quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black . no complaints.. great service . great price
0	like a permanent wedgie , these kept riding up my crack . i do n't recommend these at all ... the liquid metallic look is only useful if you 're going to be a male stripper . otherwise , you 've got liquid metal up your crack ... not very appealing
0	i have goddess bras , and it seems that each style has it 's own sizing . the love at first sight bra fits wonderfully , while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be
1	i 've been looking for black sport socks for a long time ! finally , a black comfortable , cushy sport sock of medium thickness . i 'm completely satisfied
0	when the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing . i called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece . i would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces
0	hole in pocket , not completly sewn . charcol heather shrank 2 sizes . blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve
1	i found it very comfortable with good fitting . i bought 4 pairs in last 3 and half years and this one was the best . i gave it 5 stars based on comparing with other brands that i bought . overall quality is good .
0	after one washing , the letters were all rolled up . i was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie . the quality of the graphic was horrible
1	the service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly . just what i expected and wanted
1	great buy for 20 bucks . they look nice and fit well . they are distressed but it is not as bad as i thought it would be from reading the other reviews . they look nice with jeans and a dark shirt . pretty comfy too
1	the product was as advertised and delivered on time
1	i am very happy with my velour slippers .they are a perfect fit and very comfortable.i received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future
0	while they are certainly bold and noticeable -- and have a handy security flap on the back to cover your personal information -- they are n't even close to being `` leather . '' i do n't think i would have bought them if i saw the cheap stitching and smelled the strong vinyl stench beforehand . not really worth the price and definitely not worthy paying the extra shipping charge from the seller
1	i got and love it . however , someone else 's product was shipped inside the box . it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box . the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it . i contacted them and sent it to them myself . it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy . i hope all that get things for others send it to them too ! you never know whose life depends on it
0	i bought this watch from rei . the first one 's electronics gave it up on the first night when i connected it to the pc . on the second two the plastic housing started separating . that 's right , i had to return the watch three times , the 3rd time i just wanted my money back . also , it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading . too bad , the watch sounded so good..
0	this shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot
0	perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely , or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description . the fact is , i thought that i would be receiving 84 plastic stays ( 3x28 ) , 28 each in 3 different sizes . at $ 8.00 , that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays . what i got , and i confess that the product description could be interpreted this way , was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes . when you add in the $ 4.00 i was charged for shipping ( actual us postal service postage on the package was $ 1.84 ) , this really is a poor deal compared to other available options . about 43 cents for each plastic collar stay ? a bad choice
1	this is a quality sweatshirt that i am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather . i have had trouble , in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . the only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . the service was excellent and i will return for more bears gear
0	i am in great shape . however , i can not get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension . obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches . the idea of `` medium '' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards . my body fat is low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . as is common in men of my age , lower back problems are not unusual . i have a 32 '' waist . is that not `` medium '' sized ? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems . the draw string is fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems to be the fashion , anyway . just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing . they looked like crap after the first time i washed them . i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like `` old men 's '' underwear . that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry . i am not a mean hearted kind of guy . so , i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again .
1	this is a form fitting , but not to snug nightshirt . gives freedom of movement , yet also allows some comfort with a nice breathable material . deffinitly will order more of thes
0	i purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because i have a hard time walking in really high heels . they are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap does n't hold my foot firmly in the shoe . when i walked around in them , i could feel them `` flopping '' . also , anytime i raised my foot ( to simulate my fiance taking off the garter ) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe . so , just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe . for the price , this is not worth the buy
0	i love vanity fair . their bras just fit me perfectly . when this bra arrived i quickly found it was not vanity fair . not only that , but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material . i tried it on in hopes it may fit . it was the most uncomfortable bra i have ever tried on . not because of size . it was bulky , rough and obviously inexpensively made . the tag said something along the lines of , `` made in hong kong .
0	i was happy at the appearance of the bag , but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack . i received it around christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell . it still smells making it unable to use
1	i highly reccommend this bag for anyone ! it is a big tote , which is perfect for a college campus , the airport , the beach ... really for any purpose . it is reversable and i was very suprised at how durable it is ( great quality ) . when people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part .
0	the vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors , and make it so i can not wear them at work . i love rockports in general , and these are comfortable and well made as expected , but they leave a trail of scuff marks
1	this swim jock is a great all around jock . very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps . mine has taken a beating , and has not fallen apart like other jocks i own . the swim style is cut very low in front , with a fairly small pouch . not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts , it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play . the low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans , not to mention the barely there skimpy factor . heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans ... ..looks and feels hot ! if you 're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear , this jock is a great buy for the price .
1	i ordered this bra as well as the olga women 's perfect fit full figure , black , 38ddd . this bra provides much better lift , support and separation than the olga . i think it is because the cups are seamed . i 'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature ( i 'm 5'2 '' ) , and also has a large bra size ( i 'm a 36ddd ) .
0	these slippers are anything but comfortable . besides the sizing being to small , i felt like i was putting my foot into a kid 's slipper . the width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone 's foot , and the inside material is also anything but comfortable .
0	look , it 's on sale ! usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00 . and you wo n't find anyone else wearing this original . make your drunken friends dizzy with envy . spill anything on this shirt , it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill . worth every penny . as a bonus , you can also wear this shirt while hunting .
1	look what i found ? where ? under there ! under wear ? ... right there ! it says , `` be the first person to write a review '' for jockey boxer briefs . hmmmm ... no wonder no one has reviewed these yet -- who writes a review for men 's underwear ? ok , fine , i 'll do it . i love these , my preferred brand and style . your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item . i only buy these in black as i am a firm believer that underwear ( men 's especially ) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it 's time to change them -- it 's better to be left wondering what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background ! these hold up well for the price . nothing lasts forever . the elastic band is usually the first to go ( after many repeated washings ) before the material gives out . i.e . they will fall off before they rot off . finally , so i can feel like i have done a complete job in reviewing these , i had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the weggie test - and these shorts handled it well ... extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed . i give these a `` ten tippy toes '' rating for how well they performed in the test .
0	big for the size advertised , not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals . hoped it would shrink , since i 'm a perfect 6 , and it did n't . disappointed
1	the overall quality of the garment is excellent . the fabric is of very good quality , as is the stitching . the sizing is also accurate . however , the tank top i received was not the one i had ordered , but a substitute ! thus , four stars , not 5 . in the future i will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable
0	i saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute , however , when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe . very very disappointed , i will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again .
1	very smooth transaction and timely delivery . first time on-line shoe buyer . i tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them . i saved about 35 % by purchasing here !
0	i never wear this top after having purchased it . the stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them . the shirt itself hangs very awkwardly . i prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and , therefore , is n't very flattering . i think i 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon . generally , i have been pleased with adidas products , but this shirt did not work for me personally .
0	product was supposedly shipped 1-4-07 and still do not have i
0	the footbed on these clogs is very comfortable , but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily ( in my case , after two wearings ) the seller 's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside , they wo n't take them back . i had to sew the buckles back on . in my opinion , $ 100 shoes should n't need to be repaired after two wearings . the suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color , but not what i expected when i ordered
0	the scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated . i have two problems with the scarf : 1 . i thought `` sheer '' meant sheer . 2 . i expected the edges to be finished ( hemmed )
1	ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase . i just wish it was n't `` hand wash only '' .
0	these bootie/slippers are terrible . they do n't ever stay on , there 's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made . i would give these 0 stars if i could , it was a complete waste of money- do n't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are
1	the product was delivered in a timely manner and is a good quality product
0	a good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . the previous model called the sawtooth had the shank , and the tigertooth does not . i recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe . by the way , i just loved the sawtooth from columbia . the business decision to drop the sawtooth was a mistake . the shoe was great for rocky desert hiking . i convinced 6 of my friends to buy it
1	protects the vision m without restricting it 's use or synch connection . flip screen provides extra protection but does n't always stay in place . shipping took a little longer than expected ( more than a week ) but was reasonable
1	shoe pretty true to size , good shoe for the money . i buy nike shox often and decided to try these for the price . not as cushy as a nike shox but also half the cost or less ! for the price it is a comfy shoe and i would recommend it if you have wider feet and or do n't want to send $ 90.00 and up for shox
1	this is the only shoe i wear for high impact jazzercise classes four+ times per week . i have a wide , flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly . and with boot cut jazz pants , they look great !
0	i always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from dickies . they are very stiff and tight fitting . they should have actually been baggy on me , being the size that they were
1	i 'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability . i just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in arizona to wear them more often :
1	i got this hat because it reminded me of what jack nicholson wore in one flew over the cuckoo 's nest . i 'm happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm . cashmere is very soft and it breathes well ( my head never feels too hot )
1	these shoes not only look great but feel wonderful . they are so light weight and comfortable . great product at a great price
0	i would not buy this product again . it hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end
0	for starters , this shirt is not a lighter , royal blue like it is pictured ... .it is a very dark , navy blue . very dark . also , the sizes run big . every t-shirt i own is a size large ... ..this shirt is a size large , but is way too big . be warned
0	i bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately , interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts . i usually lift weights , have no prior injuries , and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form ( i played a college sport , etc. ) . after a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that i could barely move them regularly . it was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier ( free weights included ) . perhaps i was doing the exercises incorrectly , but that seems like a real risk with a video like this .
0	i never recieved the product . the order was cancelled by the sende
1	my wife shopped around at amazon looking for her grandmother 's 88th b-day ( coming up soon ) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf . every silk scarf she came across she would say , `` what a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are . '' before she found vietmade silk scarfs at amazon , she had looked online stores at macy 's , nordstorm , jcpennies , but could n't really compare with the ones vietmade made . i agree with my wife when she said , `` this place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices ! ! '' when we got the scarf today 4/10/07 ( ordered 4/4/07 ) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself , one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law . my wife and i definately recommend this place and we 'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future . also , delivery was on schedule , good packaging and love the scarfs !
0	i purchased 3 different embassy purses last december . none of them were the quality i had hoped for , and none were used as the gifts they were intended for . in this case , the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used . i would not buy from this company again
0	i expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but i have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags . however , i do like all the compartments for organizing
0	i had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while i type -- they keep the office i work at at very cold temperatures . these gloves seeemed perfect -- because many fingerless gloves- do n't have fingerless thumbs -- but these gloves do . the cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves . i ordered the black pair . well , the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers -- they snag easily . they are warm and i would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily . but i did only pay 2.99 for them so i guess it 's a case of you get what you pay for .
1	very warm and comfortable for the price . for any price , really . nice , looks good , feels comfy , keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least
0	found the item to be poorly designed . did not fit my checks or recorder . item is useless unless you use checks with side tear
0	acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable , rubbery , poor traction giving and painful sole . i rather have cold feet then wear this slipper
1	plugged into ipod and guess what ! audio and video came out the other end ! a little spendy but what can ya do
1	we needed a ruch delivery for our vacation of some quality water shoes with a decent price , we were treated superbly . our order took less than 3 full days to arrive . we will use amazon again to fine deals and service like this
1	this was a long over due replacement for the dopp kit that was given to me when i left for vietnam . its changed very little and is still of fine quality . i expect it will provide all the use i 'll ever need
1	this mask attached using some velcro in the rear . i love it because it can be removed or put on without taking off my helmet ! at first i had some problems with my glasses fogging up , what i did was just pull it extra tight until the material was very snug with my cheeks . this drastically reduced fogging . i read on another products review that using some medical tape below the eyes would eliminate fogging ( on a similar product ) overall this has been a great buy . nic
1	my son love these shoes , i have to stop him from wearing them so much , i just wish they came in other colour
1	great product with speedy delivery . the shoes arrived before i expected and were exactly what i wanted . thank you !
0	this visor is square in shape instead of oval , i have never seen a square visor before . it looks very strange . also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . i will not be wearing mine
0	i love the style , fabric , fit , extremely comfortable ( but it is a t-shirt ) i 'm 5'2 and it does n't come past my hips
0	this cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long . the texture went bobbly after one day near the arms
0	bought these to keep the toes warm will riding my motocycle in the cold weather - worthless - no heat detected - you really feel the bulky wire if you do n't put them on exactly right - heavy d-cell draws down the sock on your leg - do n't bother , put the extra 25 bucks into your boots
0	the shoes are true to size and very comfortable . but only 3 months after purchase the sole and the upper leather are starting to seperate . really expected a better quality .
0	i am so disappointed . its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size
1	my mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels . so , i bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it ! and i quote `` it is practical and functional and makes a huge difference ( re : comfort ) for those long international flights . '' big hit !
1	these are the most comfortable briefs i have ever worn . they are worth every penny , in my opinion . they are designed for a man , plus they seem to not gather moisture , as some fabrics do
0	nice looking picture but what are the dementions of the thing ? it looks good but is it 4 '' x 8 '' or 12 '' x 8 '' ? sure would be nice to know the size before i buy ... ... ... ... . da trol
1	i just want to make something clear ... the windbreaker is not prada , the tag reads miu miu , a very good brand , but definetely not prada . i found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket . i layered it with a black yohi yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect ...
0	i ordered 5 of these belt buckles . the company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they did n't actually have this belt . i needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it was n't in stock i could have ordered it elsewhere
0	the pants that i ordered for my size were very small . they were n't true to size at all . i would not recommend this item to anyone
