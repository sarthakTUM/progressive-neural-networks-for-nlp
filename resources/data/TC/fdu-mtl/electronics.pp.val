0	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company , plus i liked the look of it . but after just 5 months after purchase , and not even using it that often , it has already broken . i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player , so i am very disappointed . if i were you , i would buy a different cd player
1	i was burned by another company with i bought their product and they did n't offer a replacement plan . the item died and no one can repair it
1	great gps unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that . clear easy to read display and instructions . menus and interface are self-intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it . no downloads , activations or learning required . satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast . accuracy is impressive with spot-on instructions and updated maps . even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled . after looking at the garmin and magellan units i thought this was the best unit for the price . it has the largest screen and the most features for this price range . a previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of bluetooth capabilities to which i completely disagree . the fact the bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive . also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand . all manufacturers seem to sell them as options ( garmin included ) .
0	the one i ordered works , but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit i received has a slightly-flawed location . the nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle ( outlet ) . my nub is slightly too high , preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet -- because of this nub , it 'll only work in the bottom outlet . i see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place..
0	i want to believe all of the positive reviews ; i really do ! but at the moment i 'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware . i know , i know : do it in recovery mode ! whatever that is ! ( do n't worry , i 've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times ! ) and as for customer support ... i got a message giving hours and `` good bye '' ( i did called during the hours cs was supposedly open ) . i had a mpio and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual ( so big and so little information ! ) are not intuitive or easy to use . maybe the mac nation is right . and as for that first review posted here on amazon.com , i hope that guy got a bonus ; he must be working for cowan ! don
0	i use to love maxtor . still have one from 1999. so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers . well , the darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone . i did have a lot of it backed up but still , what a pain . now that seagate owns them , spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive . or get a couple of these and raid them . but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping
1	it works fine , but it gets really annoying when you 're using it with a widescreen mac and a widescreen tv . the zoom function most plasmas and lcd tvs have is 16:9 aspect ratio , whereas macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio , so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you 're trying to display , or have massive letter-boxing . after three months , i still have n't had any glitches that were this adapter 's fault . if you have hdmi or dvi on your tv or projector , do n't bother with this . go straight to dvi with a mini-dvi to dvi adapter , then get a dvi to dvi cord or a dvi to hdmi cord
0	what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service ! i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play . i took it to the apple store in mall of america ( minneapolis , mn ) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it . i go back home ( ok ) and it still does not work . apple said for $ 113 they 'll fix . gee thanks ! i 'll be looking at another brand ! apple stinks
0	i wish they had a rating for zero stars . i bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters . that 's a 24 % success rate . i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters . memorex has really gone downhill .
1	item works perfectly fine . a little slow on the shipping , so i suggest getting the faster shipping with the purchase of your item . my experience could not have been better . excellent job thank you very much . great experience .
1	i have two ipods that do n't work . i bought a shuffle first and that has an error that i ca n't fix and apple ca n't fix . so , i thought i 'd buy 1gb ipod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer . so , this time i made the right decision and bought the 30 gb zune . wow ! the zune is so much better ! it has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely , instead of making you frustrated like the ipod . the screen is perfect . sound quality is excellent . 5 stars for the zune .
1	these batteries have been awesome . my digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100 's of photographs . flash recharge is very quick . highly recommended
0	this little scanner is not worth the price . it 's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use . there is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency , large gaps in between the frequency ranges it 's programmed to receive , and very limited memory capabilities . the small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device , looking from any angle and the backlit lcd display is unreadable . reception of this scanner is poor on all of it 's ( very limited ) bands , though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna . the scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources . the squelch is practically useless on this thing , it 's either on or off , it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full , as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it 's set just above the static level on any empty frequency . the sound quality from the built-in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding , but at least there is a jack for an external speaker . on the bright side , the chassis is well built and strong , the buttons have a decent feel , not to light nor too stiff . the knobs turn with ease , but will not change their settings due to road vibration , they stay put where you set them at . the fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall , but it 's not enough to make up for it 's lacking feature set and poor performance
1	i bought this mouse about three months ago , and i love it . it works on every surface , and the scroller works well too . the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short ( about 2.5 feet long ) , and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop , which means that i only have about a foot to work with . although , i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left ( good deal for the left-handed population , i guess ) . some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled , but i have n't had any problems with that
1	i 've owned and use the sony 256mb memory stick pro pictured ( in black ) , and currently also use a 1gb sony memory stick pro . i 've not had any problems with them , formatting or otherwise , over long periods of heavy use . ok , a little pricier than , say , sd cards , but a good quality product for sony digital cameras .
0	i purchased the md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the md681 . i really like the md681 but i could never locate one of its expansion handsets ( everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock ) . overall i 'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use i am already looking for another phone . handheld phones : i like them more than any other phone i 've tried . unlike most phones these days they 're big and have a very solid feel to them ... it 's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation . the buttons are a nice size and easy to use . the hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well . with one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good , but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it 's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation . the shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better . it 's a few clicks and slow to access ... almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand ... or copy the number to the local units phonebook ... which defeats the purpose . as for the answer machine : once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages , if any , are in the system ( is it just me or is that poor design ) , so if you listen to messages when you partner is n't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages . the quality of voice messages is a bit grainy . i also like how the handset docked in the older m681 ; it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base ... the md781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk .
0	a nightmare ! do n't buy from electronics expo ! the 1st sharp 52 ' lcd tv was late , had a smashed hdmi 4 dead pixels . the replacement tv had even more dead pixels electronics expo , sharp , amazon visa all gave me a horrible time no respect . so i am stuck with 2 damaged tvs now still fighting for a refund . my advice to all - get a sony from a local store for perfection no worries
0	i own a magellan meridian marine unit . just found out that you can only get 1 access code per program . i purchased 2 64 meg cards in hopes of downloading more than 1 map per card . not only can i not down load more than 1 map , i can not get an access code for additional cards . lost money all the way around . magellan offered me the opportunity to buy the blue nav xl charts at $ 179.00 , but low and behold , they come with the same defect of 1 unlock code per program . i was a believer in magellan , but switching to garmin today ! david
0	i 've owned two of these now . the screen 's great and i love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children . our 2-year-old drove to new mexico and back ( well , we drove and he watched videos ) with this thing . unfortunately , both units broke after less than a year of use . the first one just stopped working ( with a dvd permanently trapped inside ) . the second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that 's happening once a minute now . so i am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one . all of these little players seem to have reliability problems , so my main advice to everybody is buy the extended warranty and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you will be cashing it in
0	this unit will not fit all lighter sockets . i 've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife 's saab 9-3 . the 33185 version does fit
0	this is my fourth epson printer and probably my last . the epson rx580 needs several ink cartridges . if any of them is out of ink , you ca n't print at all . if you 're out of yellow ink , you still can not print a purely black/white document ! ! the system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out . i really resent that epson is taking advantage of customers like that
0	check 10 cases , at least 6 are broken in new box . i do n't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces .
0	obviously , it 's cheap . but i 've had mine over a year now ... . no it has n't failed , but it does scare me . besides the plastic cracking , the fan is making me nervous . about half the time now when i turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise , which changes frequency over time , slowing down . i have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well , and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings ( because it vibrates quite a bit ) . this vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside , and i 'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my hd to crash and lose all my photos , music , backups , etc . currently shopping for a replacement , and i would not recommend this
1	the sony str-dg600 7.1 has worked as expected and is a high-quality system at a great price
1	i was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies . hearing is believing . it gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that i simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub i had purchased . for movies , it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy . it really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market . i am not certain it can go as low as 27hz since i have not measured , but i am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls . i just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system i could . i was able to do so with the addition of this sub . i am glad i found and tried it before paying much more for another sub i was considering . yet i hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub . its peak dynamic power is 250 watts . but the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier . therefore , it is a 150-watt sub
0	despite what the belkin folk told me over the phone , this does not work on a mac
1	i bought this in lieu of the fuji counterpart which was out of stock in amazon . since the fuji finepix e900 runs on aa batteries and its ac powercord/supply is an option one has to buy , this reader is a cheap , quick and even more portable alternative for downloading pix to my mac
0	waste of time . software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible . i would n't pay 10 dollars for this product- yes it is that bad . accuracy rate was about 25 % and the mistakes were beyond spell check . they look like some new form of reformed egyption . do n't buy !
1	i have had other apc battery backup 's in the past , and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit . given our power failures , brown out , and the high wind and storms in our area the apc does an excellent job . i have not only my desktop pc , but my scanner , printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures
1	i got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it . the unit is beautifully designed , fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small . my only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong . i live in a tough area for reception , and there 's slight static on my favorite stations . the fm antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit , but the reception is still not totally clear . that being said , i 'm glad i got it , and when my wife 's happy , i 'm happy
1	i have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months , i have only had 1 burn badly . have n't found a dvd player yet that they wo n't play in
0	i ordered the cobra hg a1500 high gear cb antenna . they keep sending the cobra hg a1000 . now i 'm stuck with a antenna i did not order nor do i want .
1	the product works well for my space and needs . one note to amaazon . when you ship a $ 400 item , thats semi fragile , and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball , how does the consumer deal with physical damage ? the item is so massive to ship back , and most likey costly . i experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right . i was worried how the shipping would be handled , and sure enough , i was worried rightfully . the dvd tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out . the top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in . even with all the packing samsung supplied , it could not protect the product from the shipping company . it will be such a hassle to try and exchange this , that i am not sure if i will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again . other than that , i have purchased smaller items , and less fragile from amazon with no issues . i realize that the shipping damage canot be held on amazon , as it is out of their control . i just do n't think i will roll the dice on something like this in the future . too bad , it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen
1	a great and economical replacement ! this product saved me a lot of money . the red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem
1	i use print works cd/dvd envelopes and was worried when i ordered this product that the envelopes would n't fit top-up which is important for me because i label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier . the envelopes are just a hair over 5 '' wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly . there is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy . i ordered four of these and am glad i did . i keep them on a shelf side-by-seide and the make a perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds . i will most definately be ordering up more of these when i need more room ; these boxes are great . if you use a 5 '' wide envelope , rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds .
0	i burn about 50 cds a week in live music trades . i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last . after a year or so , they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems . any scratches that they have only make it worse . i recommend using sony , fuji , or tdk . all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just do n't stand the test of time . so if you care about preserving your cds , do n't use these ones
1	i purchased this remote to replace a broken tv/dvd/vcr combo remote . before buying it i checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo . this was the only one that definitely could . it has worked well ... a couple features are not available but i expect that with any replacement control . i 've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine . now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered
0	i have been a subscriber for 4 years . back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue . the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving 3 calls a day for payment . i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment , payment was made . calls stopped for another week . the radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again . i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother , at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm . they offered me 3 months of free service to come back , anyone who cancels can get this by the way , and i refused . the 3 calls a day continued for the next week , i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system ... . 2 more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that . 40 dollars . i call in and state i never reactivated my radio , thus i do n't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed . the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of , 2 weeks later i get another bill . i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences . i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved , and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything . so then last month i start receiving collections notices . you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections . i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back . this apparently has taken care of the issue , though i never received the call back . this week i called 6 times , 3 of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason , and was told each time that it had been resolved . so hopefully this time it really is ... to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp3 player
1	i bought this card to be used with an ipaq hw6945 it has enough capacity for gps maps , programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from sandisk that is supported by the ipaq . the reading / writing speed is ok too . very good product for only 18 bucks
0	i was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming , and its response time did deliver . it is more precise in it 's cursor control than any other mouse i 've used . however , it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me . i find it 's side buttons are difficult to use . they 're very small and their action is not to my liking . further , i was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using mac os x tiger . the steer mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons . i 've found nothing that supports those buttons on the mac platform to date
0	ok ... . i bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain ... hey 5gb for less than $ 100 what a deal . once you get the hang of loading and working with the windows media player its not a big deal to load . unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs ( which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs ) you get really good at it . had it for about 4 months before it stopped even recognizing the hd and no longer worked at all . i thought maybe the reason was that i had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better ... right ? so i stupidly bought a brand new one.. again less than $ 100 . this one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within 2 months of reciept and i just recently got the `` not recognizing the hd '' message . i am in hopes of getting it to work but for right now its just an expensive paperweight . i am 0/2 with these players so i do n't believe that they are worth the shipping it takes to send them back . beware of this product
0	i wanted to replace a lexar 1gb with this , but i 'll keep looking . i used it to transfer a 700mb , 2300 file my documents folder to a new pc . the transfer seemed pretty slow , but deleting those files from the sandisk took *61* minutes ! back it goes
1	i bought this product to hang a 42 '' lcd . i am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns . the mount is only 32 '' wide . the `` virtual axis '' tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me . there are only two tilt options with this mount , vertical ( hugs wall nicely ) and the 5 degree . being 32 '' wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16 '' centers . make sure you get at least 2 studs . my experience is this mount does not support vesa 400x800mm pattern . 800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart . my tv did have another attaching pattern but i had to use the m5 bolts ( provided with mount ) . i would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where i could use the thicker m8 bolts . a 42 '' lcd is n't going to weigh as much as a 50 '' + tv , so take that into consideration . i am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy .
1	cool ! i can expand my-single-usb-port-laptop more flexible . from single peripheral to be quadruplet . i can plug flashdisk , mouse , external and digital camera in same time . worth money for usefull gadget
0	very disappointing ! i was hoping i could at least get one or two viewable network affiliate vhf stations . instead , the best the antenna could pull in was color-enhanced snow and sound laced with static . tried all three antenna hook-up options . in fact , my set pulled in the same signal with or without the antenna
0	this cheap piece of plastic broke within 2 months of me owning it ! ! buyer beware !
0	i have now been shipped two iskins for my 60gig , and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place . there are at least three flavors of 60 gig ipods in the marketplace at present , and more coming , it appears , so be careful which one you order . the manufacturer 's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin , even if you know the model number of your ipod . i also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake . throw it away .
1	this xd memory card works perfectly with my camera fujifilm finepix f650 . good buy for the price
1	i bought the 128mb card 8-9 mnths ago . at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller ! finally it gave a 'error reading card ' message and stopped working . customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt . they replaced the card is 7 days . they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered 'lost ' in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it ! i was impressed with the excellent support , but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life . would i buy it again ? yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well
1	when the room temperature hot and no one else wants the air conditioner turned on , this desktop air conditioner cools just my 7 feet by 7 feet personal space . it 's heaven . i would n't be without . this is my second order
0	i just bought these matte labels . when i printed a photo , i noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality , and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels smudge when fingers are lightly run over the labels . has anyone experienced this ? please share your story
1	these folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory , and amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it 's like money in the bank . i hope no one comes in and tries to `` improve '' things .
0	i purchased this product and could n't get it to work on a pc , laptop , or pda ( cingular 8125 ) . not only does it not register in any sd/minisd card reader , but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well . i am currently pursuing a refund
1	i just made a long trip from miami , florida , all the way to s. carolina , with a explorist xl loaded with directroute v3 , everything worked just fine , i installed the software , unlock it , upload the maps , all with out any problems , the unit was very fast and accuracy did n't need to keep it over the dashboard , from inside the vehicle worked very well , never took more than a minute to track all satellites , the street route where very accurate , never got lost , working with poi 's was very simple , did n't have any problem handling very large maps i really recommend this unit
0	i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen , i sent it back and it has been 2-3 months i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
0	i have the same criticisms as many others . i had to put on rubber gloves to open the battery compartment . after turning it off after the first use , i could n't get it turned back on again and returned it to the store . i loved the size , but i bought a nice wireless by microsoft ; not a mini , but easy to use , a battery compartment that opens without difficulty , and a nifty little snap-in receiver that turns the mouse off automatically . take it out , put it in the usb port and the mouse is back on again . price was comparable , even though i pay a lot more for these items , living in the caribbean . amazon does not ship anything but books , cd 's and dvd 's to the caribbean
1	i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity . it worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which would n't fit in the normal outlet at the same time . it 's small , rugged and light so it 's easy to pack
0	i was pretty disappointed with the tune belt because of two main reasons . first , i had to take my shuffle out of the protective rubber case that i usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the tune belt . that was n't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve . but then i went to wear it for a run , and the arm-band was too small for my arm ! i have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training , but nothing outrageous . i would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users . this is unfortunately not the case . so if you have larger than average biceps ( say 17 '' amd up ) , save your money ...
1	i just purchased a mogo mouse , and i 'm *amazed* at how usable it is . i was extremely skeptical ( and probably would n't have bought one ) until i was able to try a colleague 's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is . the one thing - and it 's a pretty big thing - is the lack of `` scroll-wheel '' technology . that 's a sorely missed feature in this mouse . that said , there are always trade-offs , but in this case that 's the only one . battery life seems great , usability is great , convenience is great ... just add the touch pad and it 'll be the mouse for notebook computer users !
0	this is the worst thing i have ever owned ! ! ! ! it broke ( said there were no cd 's inside ) after about a week ! do yourself a favor do n't get this product , do n't buy this brand and do n't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
1	these were double the price on another site ! my little girl loves these speakers ! she is using them with her pc . my only complaint and it 's my complaint and not my lil girl 's ... is that the sound quality is poor . obviously , not the speakers to get for real sound quality ... but kids love them
0	very disappointed in this phone . i have an early generation uniden phone ( without answering machine ) that was a total joy . this turkey has weak audio and ear-piercing intermittent static . if you bother to look at earlier reviews , you will see that this is a common problem with this phone . avoid at all costs
1	they say it 's quiet , and it holds tons of data . they were correct . fast access speed , easy installation , an overall fine product . have not used the feature that let 's you back-up your entire drive , but we use it in our lan for shared files , and it 's comforting to know that we 've got these files stored redundantly . this box does just what it claims to do , the warranty of merchantability ( from my old law class ! ) .
1	bag is attractive and very sturdy . the computer fits securely and is well padded . i recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well
0	i have to rate this product and this company as horrible ! ! i purchased the x2 in 12/2004 . everything was fine . in 6/2005 , the lamp blew . less than 300 hours on it ! ! ! i called the company . they said sometimes it happens . i questioned the projector . they said i just needed a new lamp . $ 300.00 later ... ..oh , you can only get the lamps from them . you can only get service on the x2 from them . i get the new lamp . it just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be . additionally , the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew . maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago ( when it was still under warranty but they would n't look at it ! ! ! ) no . they say no . the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place . the projector was blown clean on a regular basis . this projector was not mistreated or misused . infocus says `` sometimes this happens '' . they , for $ 250 , plus $ 30.00 shipping , will fix the fan . i also need to buy a new lamp-another $ 300 . the company keeps saying- '' it is out of warranty '' , `` sometimes this happens '' , `` 1400 hours is just what some lamps get '' , etc. , etc , . etc.. they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product . i will get a new projector-i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one . my new projector will not/will never be an infocus product . they have failed to stand behind their product . their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties . do n't buy infocus ! ! !
1	this watch is not only the best watch i have ever owned , it is the only day time watch that i ever use . i love the 1,3,5,10,20 , 30 minute timer found only on this watch . i love it so much that i buy several and change out the band to match different outfits ! i do wish that this watch came in a more dressy version . i also hope that casio continues to make this watch for people who need a timer and a dependable alarm
1	overall a very nice charger , though recharge times are n't even close to what is advertised . the display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair . the 900 mah hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless .
1	wow ! i did n't trust the other review . i needed a mini amp , so i decided to bought this one , because of the price and of the dual purpose . right out of the box , it actually smell bacon ! ! amazing , it was true ! and not only that . if someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp , and do n't want to stop , this is the mini amp for you . ca n't believe the speaker in it . and , about the disto , well , is ok for practice . wo n't regret about it .
1	i used it in brasil and had it developed . i was very happy with it . it was the very first time i 've used a digital camera
1	elegant design , sturdy construction . supports my yamaha sy35 securely . after reading the forbidding reviews i decided to assemble it without first reading the directions . it took me 10 min
0	this unit is not compatible with the sprint ppc 6700 as posted above ! make sure you call pioneer with your telephone model number for compatibility . i tried the ppc 6700 and my wife 's phone ( another sprint phone , not sure on the model number ) . both have issue and pioneer 's customer service agent was horrible and would not help solve this issue , only to blame me for not calling pioneer first ! this unit is the first device that was not compatible with my phone that i ran into
0	not very happy with this product . the software on the pc side does n't work well at all . wo n't list all my files and i ca n't get it to update changes or new folders . this bugger has way to big of a foot print . the remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies . hey i have a xbox with xbmc on it . get a clue , and copy some of it 's functionality . it continues to blow away any of the media players i have purchased
1	i do n't know what was wrong w/ the other reviewers machine , but let me assure you , this is not an inferior product . i got it on clearance @ target for $ 69.98 . i have been looking for a long time for a good portable dvd player . i have used it and had no problems with it whatsoever . plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to target . good deal all around . highly reccomended .
1	i 've owned many sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy walkmen , useful shortwave and portable radios , stylish tvs and high quality cassette recorders . i still have a sony mini component stereo model fh-e656 ( made in japan ) which i bought in 1992 for us $ 400+ ; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out cd player , i decided to purchase this new sony mhcec70 component stereo ( made in china ) . pluses : decent sound good functionality easy set-up and intuitive operation simple remote -- but only covers basic functions cons : very short speaker leads unattractive styling ( for my tastes ) -- resembles a boombox only holds 3 cds vs 5 for comparable panasonic units at first glance , i was disappointed by the cheap construction , skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies . but then i thought : in 2006 for $ 150 , i ca n't expect the same quality as i received in 1992 for $ 400 . everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in china . so , for the money , it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom . the real test will be how long the cd changer works -- to be safe , this time i bought the 2 year replacement warranty . i have n't blasted it at full volume , but it seems to have plenty of power when needed . i originally bought a $ 300 panasonic unit ( sc-pm71sd mp3 sd micro system ) which was returned because it did n't have the full data recording feature as advertised ( data recording was crippled by drm limitations ) . this sony stereo costs half as much , and has almost all the same functionality
0	this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made . it felt very light and flimsy , the definition of cheap plastic . not just the construction but the performance was terrible . it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes . this was very very frustrating . maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one , but i would n't take that chance again . i wish i could give this device a worse rating , somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate .
1	just purchased earbuds at target . excellent sound quality , expected that much due to a previous of full headphones . even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear . well worth my 100 dollars , granted , i 've only had them 5 to 10 minutes , but i wo n't be returning them any time soon
1	i agree that these are not top of the line . but they are n't bad at all . i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media . i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case . it takes longer , but i get good results . i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd . i would buy these again . ** updated on 7/3/2005 ** i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever . very happy with this product
1	i recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but i was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg . it was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers . she seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents . the only real problem that i had with is that it costed less a few days after i purchased it . but that 's really a personal problem
0	i got this case for my ws-320m , which i 've been wearing around my neck like a mp3 player . the material of the case seems to be genuine leather ( or really good vinyl ) and brushed felt . it looks good = professional looking . i 've enclosed what i hope are representative pictures of this case . all the buttons of the recorder are accessible . even when the flap is closed , the microphone/headphone jacks are available , as are the rec/stop/play buttons . if the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone , you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well . there is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the `` hold '' button on the side of the recorder . not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around , but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the `` hold '' button . however , since the hold button is meant to slide down ( away from the microphone ) for it to be released , if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case , the resulting friction would actually unlock the `` hold '' button . the belt loop is an adjustable velcro . i would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop ( so the case can not come off the belt accidently ) or a nice stiff clip ( for easy access ) , or even a riveted snap button , but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options . most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times . the case is closed shut with another velcro strap , all in all , it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport . or , being able to put it on your belt after everything else ( line-in mic , headphone , recording/playing ) is set up . the relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case ( mainly due to very small buttons ) , as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand , would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case . the case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket , and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder . my bias lies in that i like to use it as an mp3 player , and i wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive . placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such . i think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt . on one positive note , i believe this is the first time that i was the first reviewer for anything from amazon . woo hoo
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports . in my case , i had plenty of ports , but needed an extension cable , which would help me in plugging the flash drives , whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires ( i keep my cpu , under the table ) .the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough . overall good value for price
1	i like this printer . there a few minor quarks , but it 's fast and the prints come out good . the one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight . if it 's lose it will start making bad prints . it takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out , tighten it and start printing again . i am also using this with the mac osx os . though the device says it will only work with pc and mentions something about the casio cw utility for use on a mac , but no where on the casio site could i find the mentioned utility . after some searching i cam e accross this : [ ... ] this allows the cw-100 to work fine on a mac . though i have never seen the pc software that comes with printer , i have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options . this is enough to get around , since you can make a jpg version of your label , put that in the print area and print away . the jpg can be what ever image/text you want . resolution is great too . i print at 300dpi . all in all , i found this to be a great purchase . i make music and do not have the money to send out to have my cds done . this print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost . great the diyer
1	i got this monitor along with a keyboard . when i get home i plug my laptop into both and i have a huge screen to do my work on . the colors are terrific , the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen . wish i had done this a long time ago
0	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer . i wasnt impressed . i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up . i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three `` processes '' without successful results . it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs . i dont think this is a good `` repairer '' of any disc thats more than mildly scratched . my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for $ 7-10 bucks on here . i wish i wouldve kept my $ 25
1	it was easy ordering , easy delivery and satisfying outcome . love the tv
0	range is very weak probably less than half a mile . do n't waste your money
0	it is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them . on the flip side once they have been opened once , they do n't reclose very well
0	i bought this because i wanted an encrypted device that i could use to offload personal documents i receive while traveling for work , and then read them using my mac ( s ) at home . lexar jd ii is the only product i found advertised to work with both macs and pcs at the same time . my primary mac is an intel mac . early on i realized the encryption utility only runs on ppc macs . okay , so i figured i 'd use it on the ppc mac mini , and everything seeemed fine at first . then i hit a problem where my mac mini could not read video dvds . a little search on the mac support forums , and i found that installing lexar jd software disables video dvd support on my mac ! fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall . aside from the problems with the macs , i also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned , which is that you must be logged in as a local administrator to use the encryption software under windows . since my work pc is a member of a domain , i had to create a local account , log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway . kingston data traveler elite works fine under windows domain logins , unfortunately for me they do n't have mac software yet . so in summary the current lexar encryption software : - ca n't be used on a windows domain machine - ca n't be used on an intel mac - breaks the dvd on a ppc mac it 's not for me ! however if you are using the lexar strictly on stand-alone windows pcs , or you do n't require encryption , it should be okay .
1	buy it and you will not live home without it . if i would rate this product , i will rated a 6 stars .
0	i did not like the fact that this microphone needs a hard to find battery which is not included in the box it was sold
1	i bought these for my zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding , compact headphone for work and working out at the gym . if you are like me and ca n't stand all the earbuds out there , then you need to find another solution . i tried the premium zune buds at 40 bucks , and the bose quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks , but they just gave me earaches and i was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight . i read countless reviews of this headphone and i can say this is the best sounding under $ 40 headphone out there that wo n't mess with your hair . ( yes , better than even the bose earbuds ! ) if you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player , be prepared to be blown away . tight , full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids . you do n't have to crank them either , they sound rich even at lower volumes . but if you do crank them they do n't distort at all . if you have ever tried the bose quiet comforts at the stores , these sound very similar but with an open air design ! the only negative is the comfort . the little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so . i think i 'll get used to it . i 'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal ( which i had ) . that could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems . some other reviewers complained about the headband , but it sounds like they were not wearing these right . once on your noggin , the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head . this keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort . i do not think the headband is too tight , it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place . i might buy a pair of the px 100 's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading . the px 100 is the same exact phone in an `` over the head '' design . at $ 40 , i can afford to get both
1	right price and works off of usb ! the sound is terrible on macbook so this will fill in nicely
0	but the touch wheel is harder to use . i bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it . since that point time i had a harder time turning it off/pausing , adjusting the volume , using the back and forth touch points , and setting a stop point in a audiobook . this is the result of the mini being recessed into the case . i took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again . the case will protect your mini without a doubt - but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for . also , make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since i nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip . i 'll only use when absolutely necessary now .
1	picture sound all great . the only problem is that you must have an advanced degree in english , engineering , and computer science to set the television up . without my cable company making a house call setup is impossibl
1	i thought when i up graded to the plasma things could n't get any better i was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top i love this thin
0	ok , so this is probably not the best protection for your ipod , but what do you want for 6 bucks ? i 'm cheap . if you 're not , buy something more expensive perhaps ... pros : - it does protect the screen and click wheel nicely . - the flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely , which i guess helps if you happen to drop it . cons : - the belt clip is ridiculous . it 's not a stationary clip . instead it spins around , which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater . this product is not for the joggers . - the leather strap that comes with it is too short , which makes it difficult to operate the ipod when it 's around your neck . - it seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under pros above . but , as long as you never take your ipod out of the case , no worries . - this is made for the 30 gb ipod video , but it 's actually a little big for it . it leaves room for the ipod to slide up and down in the case . it makes accessing the hold switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down . it 's easier to just open the top . if you do n't care about the cons and you are cheap like me , go ahead and buy it
1	this is a surprisingly good radio at this price . it is small , compact and yet very robust and quite heavy . it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store . here are three things i really liked about this product : 1 ) the am/fm reception is outstanding . i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear . listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure . 2 ) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function . this is something sangean seems to get very well . 3 ) the multi-level display lighting can be turned off , or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright . a few things i did n't like . the pilot light for `` on '' is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night . i had to put black electrical tape over it . the aux input is a mini-jack instead of rca connector . minor inconvenience here . and finally , the cabinet is nice wood , but the finish is not as good as i think it could be . this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price . it 's a keeper
0	i sent it back . the price was right but the caller id did n't function . when i got in touch with at , they told me , maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home . ( stupid response ! ) i then asked , why would at put a phone on the market that 's not compatible with my other phones , i did n't get a reply ! ! ! they wanted to send me a replacement . i told them there is no point in doing that , if , the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones ! i guess amazon will be sending it back to at
0	this item was not practical . it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
1	excellent value for money . my razr is a fully functional mp3 player now ! thanks . :
1	i have just started with an apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all . they did n't sound real good and did n't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears . what 's the deal with that ? next came the old sony mdr 027 head phones from the closet . the sony 's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now . they worked o.k. , i guess , but in comparison these jbuds sound much better than either of the previous ones . i 'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine . i 'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models . crisper highs , great mid range , and responsive lows . set up was fast too , just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running . the jbuds actually stay in your ear . wow what a concept . they are also very comfortable due to the fact i forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing . the cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket . if you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie . better too much than not enough . so back to the closet with the sony . i guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks . i could n't have made a better choice for the money and quality . you should do the same . another quick note . the shipping went great . not too long at all and with standard usps . thanks amazon
0	i bought this headset from retailer ( offline ) , and returned it the next day . first off , i have to make it clear that i had no problems with sound . even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger ( they use 40mm drivers ) , the sound quality of the headset was just fine . however , when it comes to wearing these headphones , the only words that come to mind are `` uncomfortable as sin '' . the awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears ( and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation ) . also , i have no idea what material they used for the cup pads , but it is nowhere near soft enough ... in fact , i litterally could n't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red ( flush ) from discomfort . mind you , i also own a cheap pair of koss headphones i can keep on for hours at a time , so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either ... but these things , they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time , which is n't good at all . discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return . if your ears are tough , you should have no problem with this headset . the sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you . however , if you 're looking for comfort and good sound isolation , you 'll want to look elsewhere..
0	i ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to amazon . and i advised them why . the thx 800 cable is not blue . the thx 600 cable is blue . i called monster cable and got hold of their technical support . they said they have never made a thx 800 cable in blue . amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue
0	the pci bus does not have the bandwidth to get you gigabit speed . you will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a pci gigabit card , even with jumbo frames . your motherboard has two pci busses , and sometimes has three . depending on the chipset and the manufacturer , the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy , internal network , usb , firewire , and more , will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses . you will have to run sisoft sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the pci bandwidth it can get , but that will not be close to gigabit speed , either . best case on 33 mhz pci is 300 megabit . even if you can find which pci bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it , the 33 mhz pci busses in all consumer pcs can not handle the bandwidth of this ( or any ) gigabit card , anyway . if you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 mhz pci , pci-x ( not pci express ) , 64-bit pci , or similar , but you 're going to pay lots of money for that . worse yet that built-in gigabit interface might still be on a 33 mhz pci bus and always sharing bandwith , giving you less than 300 megabit speed . it probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework
1	i like to a lot this product , and i work very well and also has a low price , to obtain this is a good offer for who buys it
0	when it works it does extend the range . however , every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again , the pc is not assigned an ip number . unplug this extender , and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem . a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly-connected pcs . i purchased this particular d-link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di-624 router . i wasted my money buying this device . it 's useless , and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop..
1	i took my mp3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds . eveyone i tried was terrible ; so i ended up buying online . i read all the reviews , especially amazon reviews ; because the people know what they are talking about . i have bought 5 pair altogether for friends , and they love these buds too . the music i listen to ranges from tupac to vivaldi , and everything in between . my mp3 player has 9 eq settings ; i keep it on new age most of the time . the price is right , and the sound is the best .
0	i do n't like these radios becase they only go about 1/2 the mile . the battery does n't hold full charge . i would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range
0	this thing does n't work , nothing but black and white image and off center . my video card is ntsc like it said but wo n't work on the 3 computers i have . do n't buy this , buy a video converter box
1	i ca n't say enough about the tivoli am/fm radio ! it has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well . some folks might be hesistant to spend over $ 100 for a radio ... trust me - it is well worth it . my girlfriend 's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years - still sounds great
1	wow , i 'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product . despite the bad reviews , i bought it anyway . i still believe in a motorola . guess what ? not bad . i bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my siemens . the siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago . this moto phone has the features most people will ever need . the shared phonebook is very valuable . a loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless . incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent . i do n't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality . ok , the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home . after about 75 meters with 3 walls in between , i can start to hear the voice i 'm speaking to , crackles . i just did this for test but i can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house . i am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference . with regard to the phonebook , i wish i can enter more characters each address ! the maximum characters i can enter is only 11 . i think i can enter about 20 on my siemens . another minor quirk is when someone called , i could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party . not with this phone . i still have to press the `` flash '' bottom everytime before i can start talking . build quality is excellent . it is a little on the heavy side which i like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic . even if i squeeze the handset hard , i did n't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping . i tried the pana , v-tech , uniden , ge , and att in a local store and the motorola is tops . you will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here . i personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around . if you do not see it that way , it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product .
1	i bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me ! so far it does what it 's suppose to do . i am pleased . it 's a little clunky , and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended . we 'll see how it works in 6 months
0	when we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the cisco label . when we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and no tech support ! if you read the boards on the linksys site you 'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different isp 's and areas of the us since this item has been released . please do n't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage , you 'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through
1	this cable really cleaned up the display image . i had been running another monster cable - the 6 meter version . i needed the length before because of the way my system was configured . i have a review under that cable about how quality does matter . and so does length . at the time i wrote the review i was just ordering the cable and was posting what i had found out in researching digital video signals . everything in there stands true . i changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because i could now get away with a much shorter cable . i installed it this morning and the difference , while not earth shattering , was definitely visible . i use this cable to connect between the video card on a media pc and my tv ( sony rear-projection lcd ) . the image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows , text , etc. , and the image was n't as clear as i had hoped . while the image looked good , it did n't look great . that 's why i decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $ 79 bucks . the difference is somethine like going from a regular rf feed to your tv and component video cables . now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming . it actually brings out detail i could n't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on fsaa and filtering so video games have a more realistic look . and that they do . i do n't know how other brands compare to the monster cables as i have n't tried them . what i do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display . you can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing . one more thing while i 'm here . i want to thank amazon for going the extra mile on customer service . i had a dvd disappear somehow during shipping . ups said they delivered it but i never received it . i asked amazon if they filed the report with ups or i did to file a claim . what i got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way . that is service . thanks amazon
1	plugged right in and worked like a charm . no software to configure . great buy . great product
1	great item . picture great , sound great , connection choices great . one problem : being located about a foot away from an under-cabinet radio , the presence ( shut off ) of this tv produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio . to eliminate this sound you must unplug this tv from the power source ! or , optionally , move it at least three feet away , which in our case is not practical . very curious !
1	i 've had this phone less than a week , but i have been pleased with it 's performance so far . the set up was somewhat tricky , as many , if not all skype addresses use a period in the address . none of the literature showed how to find the period . by accident i noticed it was available on the 1 button . after discovering that , the installation went flawlessly . if one is already familiar with the use of the alpha/numeric keypad , one would have no problems . if one is learning on this phone with the literature provided , one needs help . the phone has worked well with both the landline , and the skypeout alternatives . i 'm pleased enough that i 'm buying two more as the equipment will accomodate up to four phones .
0	manual and i can not find that it supports sacd
1	i got this on sale for $ 80 and i love it . it holds about 300 songs , gets plenty loud , has amazingly good battery life , and takes all my abuse . i play it at least 2 hours a night , if not all night , its my alarm in the morning , i listen to it in the car , on the bus , before school , during lunch , ok how bout his i use it a ton . i never leave home without it its small , easy and comfortable to hold , and it wont die if you drop it . wiht my previous player i had an issue with it erasing all the songs and i know other people who have had that issue with other players but this one has n't let me down yet . o one big plus the battery back is attached so it will never dissapear
1	after reading several reviews on portable speakers , i decided to purchase the sonic impact i-f2 for my ipod . it has great sound quality , the case is durable , it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere . you can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive . this is by far the best accessory i 've purchased for my ipod . did i mention that it has a remote control ! !
0	despite the claim that both units take aa batteries , the unit we recieved takes 9v batteries . that is somewhat annoying because one of the reasons we bought this model was because of the aa battery usage as advertised . will review performance when we 've had a chance to use it .
0	i ordered this cable a few weeks ago . although i must say that it does work fine , the cable looks cheap ( in fact , it is very thin ) and its length is less than 6 feet . as you may agree , length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that . so for $ 20 ( including shipping ) , i think it was not exactly a good deal
0	why pay $ 46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer ( impact ) for only $ 19.95 at b photo and video . i have both the the dl-150 pentax battery that came with the camera and the impact imdl150 . i ca n't tell any difference between them other than the price . camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices .
1	with my new lcd television , the hook-up was a snap and what a difference with the new hdmi compatible up-scale dvd i installed . the audio and visual difference for dvd and hd television programing is amazing with the cost at half the price at retail stores . very happy and highly recommended
0	the new ipods do not have the connections to work with firewire . so this cable will only charge the new ipods with video . besides this this is a good product for the ipods
1	i originally bought my daughter an ilive ibcd3816dt boombox for her birthday . the hiss was unbearable , so i took it back and purchased this product . much better quality control and it docks perfectly with her 2gb ipod nano using the supplied insert . very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone . it sounds great , looks good , and the controls are very intuitive .
0	i bought one of these about 3 days ago and it 's already broken . i try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my pda . not only that , but it drains rather than charges the battery . this is an extremely overpriced piece of junk , you 'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you 're trying to charge into one smart phone/pda/whatever that does everything you want
1	this bag is just pefect ! i purchased it for my dell inspiron 6400 and , although the fit was pretty snug , i am very pleased with the purchase . it is easy to carry and above everything else , is very stylish and professional .
1	speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things i was looking for in speake
0	if there were a catagory for 0 stars , that 's what i would have rated it . i bought this model only because i wanted a tv that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter . the radio works , the cd works , but the tv died after l month . and the tv was the only part i was interested in . what kind of product is this ? i would like amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit . carol gruber
0	after less than one week of use , i am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection . in 5 days , i have had to cycle power on this unit , on average , more than once per day after it locks up . the web ui fails to respond to connection requests , it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power . i have tried to work with netgear technical support , but their suggestions ( e.g. , lower mtu ) have been useless and their responses quite tardy . if you are looking for a firewall/vpn unit , i suggest you pass on this particular product
1	this is my second projector - i used an nec for the last four years , but that died on me recently . and , boy , am i glad it died - i am amazed by the quality of the ax100u - the pictures and colors almost jump off the screen at you . also , the oft mentioned ldc projector 'screen door ' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it . i believe panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it . the contrast is also truely outstanding for an lcd projector - at par with dlp systesm , but without the headaches of the rainbow effect . couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users . when i first started using the projector with my dvd player i was getting some wavy curls ( not too visible , but still there ) that seemed to flow across the screeen . however , after about 4-5 hours of use , they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls , just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well . secondly , unlike my old nec i was getting a flickering shimmer when using my hd box from my cable company . the shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture . there is an easy fix for this . go to options , overscan , and you can actually crop the edge of the image and not see it any more ... voila - no flickers and an incredible picture . be aware that this is big , bulky projector compared to some others out there . definately not a portable one - you do n't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures . this was designed as a dedicated home theater projector , not a portable presentation device . i highly recommend this projector - you 've got to see the picture to believe it - i did n't think it was possible at this price range .
1	this is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl 's room ! the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands ( volume , channel change.. ) . my daughter age 4 loves it . i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks ... the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny , very close together . i can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also very tiny . this is annoying when in my daughter 's darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button ... the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you ca n't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode . in other words when i go to put in a dvd , i ca n't just push `` open '' . nothing will happen . you have to find the right button , choose `` dvd '' from a choice of 3-4 things , and only then will the tray slide open . all in all , these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again ... although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize ... one great thing i want to point out -- there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards ( something not all dvd players offer ) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads ... .you can ff right to the beginning of the movie ! ! !
1	i just recently bought a sub-woofer and i spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect . the interconnects i looked at ranged from ridiculously over-priced to questionably cheap . i knew i wanted it to be thx certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub-woofer placement . this interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price . i must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice . some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound . wrong . this is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects . i do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs , but i do not buy into some of the hype surrounding monster cable and their more expensive cables . why only 4 and not 5 stars . i did not like the way the cable was packaged . the cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it . i would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable . getting past that , its a good interconnect that produces great sound .
0	upon the joyful news that we were having a girl , my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer . the digital camera still works great -- the printer is another matter . while this one prints beautiful pictures , the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes . as we all know , this is how printer companies make their money , through the ink . replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $ 75 at a time , give or take a few . the gray ink is used up the quickest , and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally . the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink , but for only about the first 50-70 pictures . after that . the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register -- very frustrating when you 're printing out any pictures , let alone ones of your child . yes , we do what the manual sugests for such occasions , and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads , but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion . every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to . in the long run , i will not be buying a photo printer for home use , but will rather take them to a store for processing . quality-wise , it gets you in the beginning , but does n't hold out for the long run . we have fiddled with it for two years . enough 's enough
1	everything works great . the only marginal issue is that the batteries do n't last a full eight hours . it works in the car but cuts in and out . guess i have to break down and buy the car kit
0	this is a poorly designed remote . i have six devices connected to my hd television set . the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and , in my case , routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote . i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly . at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv ( which can not turn the tv on and off ) .
0	klear screen has to be the absolute worst product i 've ever used . it has nearly ruined my 2001fp . i was stupid and used it on my primary display first , instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that 's far superior to klear screen products . my lcd now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out . my 3 year old laptop 's display looks nearly perfect because i only used the 50/50 solution on it , my 2001fp looks horrible now .
1	the lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease . product is easy to use and understand . for the money a great purchase .
0	this product has the potential to be tremendous , but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched . that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience , now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches . also , there is a big 'rhigo-skin ' logo on the front , which makes the case even that more distracting . i 'm sure that it is n't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail . what a letdown . p.s . if you are buying the 30gb version of this case , it will double the thickness of your setup
1	i love the feel of this gamepad ... after trying several others this is the best . the wireless works ok , i was 20 feet away and it was working.the batteries are what needs improving according to many posts . i thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside . with a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case . on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic . you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing . i also found new batteris at interstate battery store , 1 dollar each . the analog sticks could be a little tighter , but i like the d pad . wireless is great
0	there are brands i trust and ones i do n't . sony has always been a trusted brand . but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken . i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase , but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product . the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews : when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting . i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer . i am hoping i have better luck .
0	overall this item works as expected , but requires to be reset ( i.e . cycle the power ) once every 24-48 hours . i will be replacing it with another model
0	the product did n't do what it said it would . i cut the power to use it in my car ( i should n't have assumed it worked properly ) so i could n't return it and ended wasting $ 50 . i was extremly dissapointed in this product
0	this is an excellent item for anyone on-the-go who has an ipod nano . no longer do you need to carry those cumbersome cd 's around or get distracted while driving when a cd ends and you need a new one . why pay the big bucks for a cd changer player when all you need is this an ipod nano
1	i bought this for my husbands birthday . he was very excited . he had been looking at bags at a local store and had n't found anything as nice as this , especially for the price . plenty of room for his laptop and pens , notebooks , extra books , etc . very durable , highly recommend
0	these headphones have no bass whatsoever . i would never buy these , please keep shopping as there are better products for the money out there . the headphones that came with my mp3 player out of the box are way better then these
0	i was not sent a firewire cable as was advertised . they sent me a useless usb cable . when i contacted the seller , they did not send me the proper cable . do n't buy from this terrible company !
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder , because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs . i bought this lens cleaner and -- voila ! -- the recorder is working again . super easy to use ( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine , and the menus tell you what to do ) . highly recommended
1	these earphones are incredible ! they are comprised of excellent bass and treble . you experience everything much nicely . these earphones compared to the ipod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things . i bought these from ebay for $ 8 and for that amount of price , you ca n't regret buying these sensational earphones
0	i just purchased this item - now i 'm planning to return it tomorrow . one of the advertised features , the ability to store liner notes just does n't work properly . they just do n't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in . to me , the liner notes have value and i 'm not willing to fold , spindle , or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
0	i have been a fan of western digital hard drives for many years , but that ended with this product . i purchased an essential edition 250gb drive for my daughter as a christmas gift , by new years it was doa . giving wd the benefit of the doubt , i exchanged it for an identical replacement . this one made it until early march . three clicks and it turns off . wd says there is nothing i can do but return it under a rma . they can do nothing about the lost data . so much for using this drive for backing up important files . i 've have had at least a dozen wd drives over the years and never had a failure , they just became obsolete because of their size . this produce however ... .stay away
1	these boxes are half the size of regular cases , just right -- not too bulky like the regular ones
0	i had my pink ipod mini since feb. 2005 . it was fine until it died the next year on the exact day i got it , and the warranty ran out . i got it repaired at an apple reseller , and then it died again on the warranty expiration date . what is it with the ipods ? it 's like they have a self destruct inside ! ) : -
1	i 've had this printer for four years . i print approximately 25 documents each week . this is the first time that i have had to replace the cartridge . it 's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time , too . compared to ink jet printers that i have had , i get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets . great buy
0	i bought my wife a nuvi 350 for her birthday last august ( overall , we love the nuvi , but the mount ... no ) . the biggest `` advantage '' of the nuvi over other gps systems is its portability . unfortunately , the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature . the cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well ... and then wo n't let go . when we tried to transfer it ( after being attached only a couple of days ) , it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield ( though with difficulty and repeated tries , we have been able to move it ) . what this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in . the mount and the charging/power wire ( which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount ) are pretty darn expensive ( $ 60-70 ) which is ridiculous for a `` portable '' system
0	i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term , risky cells . it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i 'm not willing to chance it again
0	this item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of casio exilim camera , but was never delivered . now amazon wants me to review it , so here your are..
0	there are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item , and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player , well it comes with no software or anything else . if all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget i
0	really wo n't use the tv , but the cd only lasted 5 days and i use it everyday -- had to buy something else
1	they are good for the price . they have a very good sound quality , or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 . the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player , it had a low volume output . and then again , even on the sony player , i had to have the volume at 7 , and it only goes to 9 . if you have a high output player or a computer , these will be great , but if your using them for a low output or old device , these probably wo n't cut the cheese
