0	i read all the amazon reviews but still decided to go with the avent sippy cup since i had relatively good experiences with the avent bottles . unfortunately , leaking is a real problem with these cups . not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well i try to fasten the lid , but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips . he ends up with a mouth full of milk . so much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup . i orginally used playtex and he liked that well enough . i only switched because the playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear . now , after wasting money on avent , i 'll go back to playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try . i do n't usually write amazon reviews but i figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble . unless you want milk everywhere , i would definitely avoid these cups .
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months , and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere . also , the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out ... wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up , but i 'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !
1	the superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion . our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it . you can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained .
1	this is one of the best on the market . looks good and holds tons of toys and the 2 drawers on the bottom are really nice for holding books . a `` must buy ''
1	my daughter was the most happy when she was in her halo . i love these sleep blankets , the cotton ones for use in florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece . i wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits . i recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep , your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers
1	this is our third baby monitor . the first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices . this one has worked flawlessly in our home w/ zero static . the talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old ( `` go back to sleep , '' `` i 'll get you juice in the morning , '' etc . ) not having to get up and go to the child 's room is a real feature . the only reason i gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals are n't encrypted . anyone else with an fm receiver can pick up your conversations , but most monitors are this way . we took the monitor to a friend 's house and it picked up a lot of static/interference from something in the house ( video monitor , tv , i do n't know . ) since it only had two channels , we were not able to find a clear channel . overall thoughts : best monitor i 've had ( stay away from the fisherprice models ) . i would buy again unless i was in an apartment complex ( i would n't want other people listening in ) , and i would be prepared to take it back if i needed more channels
1	out of all the loads of baby gear i bought- this is by far the best money i spent . i thought , its a little spendy , but super cute . after my preemie came home the 3rd week of november and it was 27 degrees ... i realized how great this thing was . its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm . no need for a jacket that would mess up her straps ! also in the wind and the rain , to just be able to flip it over her face is so great ! this is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion . my daughter will be able to use it well into spring . not to mention , not a day goes by that i do n't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where i got it . love it love it
0	i was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first . i went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out . the sternum strap would not even snap over my chest ... i have an average build but have a chest ... .and it would'nt reach . my friend tried it also and had the same problem . i would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake
1	i have this monitor now and i 'm thinking about return it back cause although i have the volume on high but still my baby 's voice still not clear but other than than it is a good monitor i did not have any problem with the battaries or stati
1	i purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby . my plan was to carry it along with me whenever i would visit family and friends at their homes . i could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface . the blanket is 16.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 inches , which will accommodate adults well . i was pleased when i received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece . the quality is absolutely top notch ! the surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur . the only slight con i have of the essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side . this is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time . otherwise i adore this blanket and highly recommend it
1	i have no idea how our parents had us with out these ! they are the best invention ! my son likes to play with plates , so i can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating . i have a toddler and a 9 mo old . neither of them have been able to remove these things . and beleive me , they 've tried . so i dont know what that other review was talking about . they 're inexpensive , easy to use , and clean .
0	i recently purchased this gate , as i needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide . i was so happy when i found this , and for the price ! well , i installed it with no problem at all . but it is not secure . it actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it , the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break . awful and very unsafe ! ! ! target.com was very helpful in sending ups to pick it up .
1	there are a few things that i liked about my simple round about better . such as , the latch system is more difficult in the decathalon . overall though , very impressive car seat safety system . the fabric for the cover is wonderful and plush and stylish . i always feel safe when my little ones are in a britax . well worth what may seem like an exorbitant amount of money . you can not put a price on the safety of your child
1	i love this blanket so much let me count the ways ... ( 1 ) certified organic ( so hard to find ) , ( 2 ) large enough for a good , tight swaddle ( for a good night sleep ) , ( 3 ) darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket ( even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse ) , ( 4 ) soft , soft , and softer with every wash ! i just love this blanket and i feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ultimate - and i know he loves it too
0	i should have checked this out before registering for it . the lid wo n't stay shut , the bottom wipes brown , the unit leaks . i contacted the manufacturer . when telling him about the lid not staying shut , he asked , `` are you sure there is n't a ghost in the house '' ... they offered to replace it if i returned it to them , offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products . after reading these reviews i think i 'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product
0	after spending over $ 30 for this item , we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across . a seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong . would not purchase again or recommend to others
0	i bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier . this bag was ok to start and fit my britax ( a feat in itself ) but 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it broke . i would not buy it . i emailed the company and have yet to hear back
0	i got this to make sterilizing easier . i 'm not sure it does . it is kind of a pain . cartoonish in appearance , cheap looking , cheap feeling , not nearly enough room for what you have to put in , you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things . water does spill like crazy from the lid . does it really sterilize ? i hope so ! i ca n't tell . air vent bottles air dry , but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer i have . why ? i do n't know , the steam ? metal of heating unit is n't smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you do n't get cut ! i was very disappointed ! for that amount of money i should have gotten something of better quality ! you pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure !
1	we also used this netting last spring/summer/fall on our double stroller ( limosine style ) and our pack-n-play . in addition to bugs , it keeps leaves , etc . from falling into the play pen . my in-laws loaned us a second play-pen that was older and larger than the one 's sold these days . the netting also fit that but not as snugly
1	this 2-in-1 is amazing . the scent is wonderful ... too bad they do n't make it for adults : ) a very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike . it actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully . i love mustela products so much that i got rid of every other product that i had that was n't mustela . fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products . try them and you 'll see why
1	would someone be able to give me the dimensions/measurements for this mattress ? thanks so much ! i do not have this-however it made me put in a rating in order to post a question ...
1	i had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an avent bottle ( which my first took beautifully ) so i called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice . they suggested the evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple . they worked great . after swearing by avent with my first , i never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an `` old-fashioned '' type bottle . it works though so i will stick with them
1	i borrowed this pump from a mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work . i used it frequently ( at least twice daily ) for the 5 months i pumped at work . it always worked wonderfully . i never had trouble with let-down or supply . sometimes i filled both 8 oz . bottles in a 15-minute session ! unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply , i ca n't imagine this pump not working great . i did n't have any problems with it the whole time i used it
1	i have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great . easy to use and quick to sterilise . with regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment , i should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile . all babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting , and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats ( and breast pump equipment ) until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally . cleaning your baby 's bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs , so it 's generally still advisable to sterilise after washing . if you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone , it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade . the bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition . it may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth , but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous . your baby 's immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he 'll be able to combat infections more easily . it might seem inconvenient to some , but sterilising reduces your baby 's chances of ingesting harmful bacteria and it 's about the baby 's health , not what the mother 's feels she doesnt have time for .
0	[ ... ] to see how worthless the graco lovin ' hug swing is . the baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds ( the swing has a supposed 30-pound limit ) . the swing is on hard floors , is brand new , as are the batteries , and still the swing barely moves at all , even on the highest level ! when i contacted the company , they told me that the swing wo n't go as high when a baby gets larger , but this brief movie proves that it wo n't `` go '' at all ! ! instead , i highly recommend the fisher price ocean wonders aquarium swing . i only wish it held a larger baby so i could continue to use it ! [ ...
1	great product - i heard from other mommies that this was the pump to get ; i agree
1	i bought 3 packages of dr. brown 's ( through amazon.com ) standard size nipples and i received 2 standard and 1 wide . they shipped the wrong item to me . i returned the wide to the address in calabasas , california and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to right start . i enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him . since my purchase , i still have not received anything except this email from amazon.com . i rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star
1	my daughter loves this activity center . i wish they would change two things about it . i wish we could change out the toys and it folded up
1	i have always had graco infant seats for my children . i got this one for baby number 4 and love it . it is so cute ! and the cover is just wonderful for the fall and winter months . also , i love the color of it .
0	the ac adaptor and sound selections are great , but the sound is way too low , even on the highest level . i foolishly bought this , knowing that others thought it was too low ... but it really is so low you ca n't hear it 4 feet away . turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me .
1	i purchased your `` space saver highchair '' for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled . finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult . this chair works for everything ! this chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day . she also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and can not get them back in her hand . i love this chair for its size , the way the whole seat tilts ( not just the back ) , and the 5 point harness . the chair is also small so it holds her very nicely . my daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time
1	what a great product . no tools , just click , click , click , and it 's ready to use . the anchors keep the unit in place under the mattress . the frame is metal not plastic ! i am very pleased with the quality , and the look . it was out of the box , and on the bed in about 10 minutes . :
0	we have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib ... and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us . we were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us . so now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor . if you live out in the middle of no where or you do n't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you
0	my son is ten days old . i tried these bottles and was highly disappointed . the liners are a pain in the butt . once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it , if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again . i changed to dr. brown 's bottles and my son is having less gas and is n't wearing his food .
1	this is the single best new baby item that i purchased ! ! i was a mom who swore that `` my baby will never sleep in my bed '' . needless to say that did n't last 3 nights . i got this co sleeper and it was just perfect . felt much more secure with him in there . very portable too , i took it everywhere for the first three months
0	we also ordered the bedding and got the pillow . we called baby age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding . they should know there 's a problem by now and change this listing
0	this is the worst pump you could buy . i have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down . it also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while i am at work . please do n't waste your money ... ... . i also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product . if you do n't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing . i recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the loudest pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product
1	we looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we 've found . i love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down , it stores flat , and that you can add as many toys as you want . our baby has really enjoyed it . there is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time
0	my husband and i bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills . well , it did not control odor . the plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week . the odor escaped even when the pail was closed . you do save money on refills at first . but when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows , you have to change the bag more often . i used a lot of baking soda and lysol spray to help control the stink . also , the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily , and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things . i would not recommend this product
0	what to do if you just bought this product : go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house -- -maybe that will knock some sense into you after you 've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk ! ! ! as many reviewers have noted , it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly . first off , the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- why did they choose to use teeny-tiny white lettering ? stupid ! it is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials . in fact the difference between say , level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water ! trying doing that out of a standard faucet . in fact we use a filtered water faucet ( with a thin spout ) and it is still hard to get write . but that 's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio ! we are currently using a 4oz playtex bottle ( with the disposable bags ) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use . level 3 -- - still to cold , but wait , last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula ! and just try to use a vented-type bottle ... forget it ! how about an 8oz . bottle ? no way ! either way to cold or way to hot . and even though we use filtered water , this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar ( as recommended ) evey week or so . however , the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more . why ? because we know that 4oz . of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave ... every time
0	this wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid wo n't stay closed . i waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table . the wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid . do n't buy this wipe warmer , there are better ones out there .
0	very disappointed . i bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after i pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant . it has not helped me and has been annoying . the l-xl is too large but the s-m was too small . the material folds and rolls under my clothes and there 's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go . i get sweaty underneath it and it 's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom -- -which i 'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks ! this was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop i went to . i wish i 'd had the chance to try on others to compare
0	i have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months ( first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1/2 months daily ) . suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend . my dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me . thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good . he replaced `` just the pump '' in the pack with a new one . per medela 's instructions , they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it , if it was under a yr old . it would have been very late for me if i were to ship it and they have to ship it back . another thing that is happening is my back pack 's handles have started wearing down . and i hardly carry them around . i am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump . i would think twice before buying this
1	i recently purchased this monitor when my old fisher price 49 mhz sounds 'n lights monitor stopped working in one of my twins room after only a year . i could hear my next door neighbor but not my baby upstairs . i figured this one has many channels to choose from so the chances of that happening where slim . well ... it works and i enjoy this monitor so much better that i am considering replacing my other fisher price one . with this monitor i do not hear any noise from it unless my child is making noise . my other one makes a low static sound all the time , it is not bother some but i can still hear it . i would highly recommend this model . the price is great and i have not tried the rechargeable batteries yet but it is nice to know that i can take it off charge at any time and not have to worry about finding new batteries . a great find , a great buy , a great product
1	i purchased this carrier when my son was just a week old and used it for nearly one year . it was on clearance at babies r us for only fifteen dollars . it was well worth the price . the only problem i ever encountered with it was the back support was minimal . i do have frequent back problems and it does not take much to aggravate it . the weight of my son did get a little daunting at about the six month mark . my brother would also use the carrier and he claims the support was fine for him . i would say if you have back problems think hard about this purchase , if you do n't go ahead . i personally would still make this purchase . another plus is that is does not look as silly as those women carrying around their child in a sling . people never gave me those looks with this !
0	i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it . i find it a nightmare ! if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out . it does not work when on the charger . it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts . what a piece of junk . i would in no way recommend this product to anyone
0	our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed ( and i 'm an industrial designer dad , so i should know ! ) . it can hit the door frame easily , the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height . he 's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it . he has fun in it at first , but it always seem a disappointment in the end . save your time and money and get the baby einstein excersaucer . that is agreat toy and better for development skills
1	based upon reviews , i decided to go with dr. brown 's from the start . we 've been very happy with them ! a friend had given me some avent bottles she had never used so i decided to try them compare . my baby had a terrible tummy ache had never before burped so much . those avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust . for folks who complain about leakage ... .the rare times that has happened to me was when i accidentally added milk past the top marker . otherwise , i 've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage . another plus is that they 're very easy to clean ; i just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher ( i use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces ) . if you 're comparing the wide mouth to the standard , forget the standard ! they 're a pain to get liquid into ( but still good bottles ) . i absolutely love this product would never consider another bottle
1	i already have a single jogging stroller ( not a bob ) and have been happy with it . we are in the process of adopting our second child , which we had less than 24 hours notice about , so a lot of money is going to legal costs , baby stuff , and my time off of work , and as a result i was concerned about spending this much on a stroller , but is was worth every cent . with the bob duallie , i am ecstatic , overjoyed , delighted , thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out . for my first trip out , i put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk . the trip was so smooth , both kids slept for most of the time . the seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat , no problems with his head bobbing around ( pardon the pun ) . the shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride , which transits to less work for my arms . i did n't realize how much effort went into the other stroller , pushing it and turning it . the smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster , a plus when trying to lose weight . the stroller can turn in circles on itself , allowing for extremely sharp turns . very nice , especially when inside a small store , like starbucks . the windows up top are well placed enough that i can actually see my kid 's face , not just their little bodies . the straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller i 've used . there is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid 's shoulders . the straps at the waist do n't come out of the sides , ( this is kinda hard to explain ) the strap is attached in the center of the seat , and the sides come around the child , more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit . even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller . as for the mesa orange , it is more like a burnt orange , with brown trim and i am very glad i got it ! it is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos . be sure to get the tray , i forgot to order it with the stroller . the storage is a little shallow , but being double wide , there is still plenty of room for stuff .
1	this lamp is so much cuter than i was expecting . the quality looks excellent . i looked at cheaper lamps and you get what you pay for . the quality of this lamp is definitely superior to others .
1	this is a durable and quality product . my son uses it for everything , from turning the lights on to getting on the potty . i use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that i must hide from my 2 and a half year old . i must say that i am a hard core fan on baby bjorn items as they are durable , classic in design and color . this is a sturdy non-slip item it has supported me for months 120lbs ( give or take 10 lbs ! ) we used it so much that i bought another step stool , made by playskool and i wished i had bought another babybjorn
1	i love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it . i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud . i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use . so now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth . if i had to do it all over again - i would still buy this swing b/c of the design . i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall
0	i saw this and i thought it would be great . it would keep my daughter 's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops . it does do those things but it is hard to clean . it gets pretty dirty , and in the catching pouch , there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of . i used it twice and will never use it again . i recommend the table toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done . they stay in place better , and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table . i use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did . her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier . you do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag .
1	i gave this stroller as a gift . so far there have been no problems .
0	so i recieved this as a gift at my babyshower even though i did n't register for it and finally pulled it out to use it the other day now that my son is older and we 're moved into the larger tub only to find out that it does n't stick to the wall . at first i thought maybe it was my older son bumping it whenever he was taking a shower , but oh no that 's not it at all . then i thought maybe it was that i had something too heavy inside when really all i had were some rubber rings and i think maybe one tube of crayola draw on the walls crayon . but yet again , the darn thing came un-stuck . so basically the moral of this story is whenever you recieve something that you did n't register for , investigate whether or not it 's not a piece of garbage before you open up the box and get past the point of no return . literally .
1	the bundleme is a must for any mom . it works so well ! it really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets . the first time i used it i thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so i put a jacket on her . as soon as i was indoors and took her out of the bundleme i saw that she was too warm . she was actually sweating . ever since then i use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy . we have lots of snow and cold winters where i live and the bundleme original was perfect . no more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car . the top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it 's the only part that needs washed you do n't have to take the straps out of the bottom piece . you can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you 'll be indoors for a short period of time . i think that every mom should have one and i would definitely buy one again
1	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it ... the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it . i keep all of the `` out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~ ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff ... also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be !
1	it does indeed adapt it so you can run the thing in the car . my wife used it on a cross-country trip we took and it basically saved our lives . well , not our lives , but it does work
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet , it seems that first years has discontinued the product . at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website . we searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer . apparently , they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued . furthermore , the site is full of broken image links . the thermometer works well but without probe covers , it 's not a good investment . you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers . if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there , find another product with covers available
1	we 've used this seat when traveling , and everyday use at home . when our son was about 15 months old , i put the highchair away and started using this . it can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser ! ! it folds down so it can be put away easily if you 're having guests , unlike a big highchair ! great chair !
1	my baby loves it . by the way it is bigger than it looks on picture . i was afraid that it would be too small for my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect .
1	this product was very easy to use , quick clean up , and very discrete to carry in public . my husband and i are constantly using it when we are out with our child . i especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage
0	i bought this item for my daughter and it is not worth the money . the items are cheap plastic and some are even cardboard . this would be a great deal if offered at the dollar store . pass
1	it was nice of my `` ninth month wife '' to agree upon a diaper bag that i was n't too embarrassed to carry . now that the baby 's here , i 've found it to be functional as well as comfortable ; it easily holds enough clothes , diapers and stuff , and does n't feel like you 're carrying an elephant . no complaints at all , it 's a great bag
1	the hello kitty chair was just adorable , the quality and craftmanship is outstanding . my 15 month old grand daughter crawled right up into it on christmas morning and knew just how to start rocking . its just the right size . thank yo
1	i bought this for my reluctant potty-trainer , and he 's used it once and tried to go in it several times , but the real blessing has been his 6-year-old brother using it . i have one bathroom , and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat . this has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises . i do have to check the collection reservoir a lot , though , because my older son does `` go '' a lot , as big boys will . the flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty . plus , the pee collects in a part of the potty the child does n't have easy access to , unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in , then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second ( i speak from experience ) . makes it much more sanitary . the only problems i 've encountered are my kids flushing it constantly ( mostly when it was new ) , simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes , the fact that my three-year-old still ca n't quite get it that he ca n't sit on it and do # 2 , and the fact that it 's just a little off-balance , so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against a wall , you could have an icky mess . luckily , ours has only fallen over when filled with water
0	i bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received . however , it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old . my son was born 5 lb . 11 oz . he did not fit snugly into this seat , even with the head cushion . his head rolled around or rolled forward . i tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work . also , if i adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter , it would roll around a lot more ( i have leather seats ) . additionally , the material on the seat is not breathable -- it is velvety -- so my son 's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips , even in the winter . i would say that once my son was bigger ( about 14 pounds and 26 inches ) , i removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position -- this is when he actually `` fit '' into the seat , however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty , making him very uncomfortable for longer trips .
1	very easy to use , and comfortable , it did n't bother my daughter when she was asleep . stayed put pretty well considering how restless my daughter can be . easy to change off the bed when wet without having to change sheets in the middle of the night . washed about 30 times and still together and ready to use for my son next year
0	i bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first . my daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor . it fits beautifully on my graco quattro tour stroller . the big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off , revealing a screw , which scratched my daughters arm . i feel sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments . the only reason i give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off
0	before i even had the opportunity to use this product , it has disappointed me . i have washed this item per the manufacturer 's instructions . the bottom pad came out of the drier all pilled . i wonder how many more washings this pad can stand . truly a disappointment
1	this item was very cute . the different textures ( just like the bedding set ) are a lot of fun . i hung 2 on the wall above my sons changing table and he loves to look at them . my only complaint is the ribbon loops they 've sewn on to hang them . mine were not sewn into the middle of the square and so they originally hung uneven . you can easily use a nail or other type of homemade hook though
1	she really enjoyed tummy time on this mat..loves watching the fish and has toys that she can reach and grab
0	this wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move . we use cloth wipes it has burned a few , smells moldy no matter what i have done to clean it ( never happened with any of our other wipes warmers ) wo n't stay closed . it actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser ' and melted/burned the little foamish piece in it . then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table . get a different warmer this one is awful
1	this was a gift and in shopping for a pack-n-play , it seemed the best value for the price
0	the quality of this swaddle blanket is very good , i 'm not complaining about that . the problem we 've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks . this triggers his newborn rooting instinct , which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on . instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger . i recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item . we own two of them , and they keep our baby very cozy and warm
1	we love this item . i was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink . this item solved the problem . highly recommended
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months , and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere . also , the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out ... wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up , but i 'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !
0	when we first bought our baby 's mattress , it did not have any unusual odors at all . we washed the ultimate mattress pad before using it , but after a short time , we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time . we finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free . by this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well . use of the organic did not cause any problem , but since we had not yet put two and two together ( not smart ) , we put the ultimate mattress pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell . we now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress . the side that never came in contact with the ultimate mattress pad smells just fine , but the side that we did use it on has a stench you do n't want your baby sleeping on . i guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib . we actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we did n't want our little boy sleeping directly on it . when we did try that , he woke up with a mesh-imprinted face
1	well made and well priced . your kid will find a million and 1 uses for it ... more than you dreamed of as you loaded it into your cart . buy buy bu
0	i tried putting this on a shopping cart from target . this does not cover area at all ! ! i caught my baby biting on the cart handle and almost flipped ! not good ... plus its annoying to put on
1	i thought these were very good quality considering the price . i like them better than the one i bought at bru that cost much more
1	i use it while my daughter is lying down . she loves being in the tub . this just makes her float . it 's great as the get bigger to use like the ring . would buy for a friend and totally recommend !
0	i received this highchair as a hand-me-down . looks lovely , mine is pale blue and lime green , but is infuriating to clean . i have never seen more cracks , crevices , screw holes , all where baby food and slobber collect . after one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy . you will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices . a friend of mine has a fisher-price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean . the price is insane ( glad mine was free ) . i would never buy this chair even as a gift . i would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean . i would give it zero stars if i could
0	we were so excited to try a jumper for our son , but were very dissapointed in this product . first of all , he tipped himself right out of it ! with the three strap design , it 's unsturdy in the back , which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor . he seemed pretty intent on jumping , so now we 've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he 's nice and snug , but it 's still unstable and wobbly . i do n't recommend this product , and in fact , we are going to try a different brand
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it . i love the theme , but the mobile was a big disappointment . it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available , he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it . also , although the mobile matches the theme , i found that the colors were n't very stimulating . we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match , our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it .
0	some assembly is required . i consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things ... i have an engineering degree ... i 've put together bikes , furniture , installed car stereos , and this thing was an absolute pain , especially for such a simple device . i found the instructions to be woefully inadequate . i found the images to be useless , and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how to orient various pieces together . takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance . it was aggravating enough to make me go straight to amazon upon finishing to leave feedback ... i did n't even buy it from amazon . the gate itself is fine
0	i have to say that i just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail , ( i ordered online because i 'm so far from a babies r us location ) and i was excited at first . the color is great , and the cover fit perfectly , but i have n't washed it yet . actually i have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric . the fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area ( middle of long side ) . i plan to exchange this cover for another of the same , i hope for better luck with the next one , but man , the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating
1	ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional ? well , pretty much everyone i know , and they are all right of course . each baby is exceptional , in their own way . but how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians , nurses and early childhood educators ? well , i know one - mine ! i faithfully used the babyplus system when i was pregnant . one time when using it , he started knocking back . yeap , i actually felt him knock back at it , in rhythm . it only happened once , but i told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid . i was about 7 months pregnant then . well , lo and behold , after he was born people ( professionals ) do n't stop telling us how amazing he is . he is the most aware newborn you will ever meet . he is 2 months old now , and has been sleeping through the night ( 11 hours at a time ) since he was 2 weeks . he cries when he needs something , and never cries for no reason ( but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i do n't know how much that has to do with it. ) . yesterday he started reaching for objects . ca n't quite grab them yet , but it does n't stop him from trying . the pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is , how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age . he 's been holding his head up since the day he was born ( 3 days late ) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks . so , i do n't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it . i mean it could be just an accident but ... all i can say is that i will definitely use this product with our future children . i would pay thousands if i had to ( and we are not rich people ) because its worth every penny
0	nine days from mn to pa seems too long ; perhaps target direct got process problems . i am not satisified ... got the same three pack of bottles which i bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local cvs for $ 1.50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it
0	i purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house . though i am very sorry i purchased it . when you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal ( with the foot part of the swing much higher than the head position ? ? ) very weird ? ? while it swings , i am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor . also , there is no head support . on the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- this is not the case . my daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is no head support with this swing . my daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it does n't seem to have the support that other swings have . i have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is much better . to add- the mobile is horrible . it 's really pitiful and hard to believe that fisher price put something like that on the market . the entire swing has a poor design to it .
1	the car seat itself is awesome , but the condition it arrived in was awful . the box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind . there was nothing covering the seat ( like a plastic bag ) so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat . it was a gift for my grandson for christmas so i did n't have time to return it and hope for a timely return . it took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat . simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me .
1	i love my new stroller . i also have a graco travel system . the graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle . i think the peg steers very well , unlike what some other reviewers have said . i even set up an obtacle course in the store i bought it at to make sure that i could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it . it handled like a dream . my husband and i went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator , instead of waiting in the long line , my husband carried our 1yr old , and i carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened . it was a breeze ! we did the same thing when we left the mall , only this time i collasped the stroller , the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs . it 's still winter , so i have n't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade , but hopefully that will work out ok . i would reccomend this stroller to anyone , infact i 've told two of my girlfriends about it , and they have already added it to their gift registry . you will be happy with this stroller
1	i bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen , too small for a full-size high chair . the seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months . i do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but i have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting . the cloth lining is very easy to remove , wash , and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean . the tray is easy to put on , remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink . i have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when i need the chair for entertaining others . my daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and , now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster , enjoys having her own place at the table . i highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort .
1	i am surprised to read that people do n't like this mirror . we have had it since our son was 1 mon . and we still use it at 7 mon . we have a trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his britax marathon carseat . it has been great for road trips ( our son was entertained even on a 9-hour trip ) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store . we do n't always use the music/lights but the mirror is always handy . we have never had trouble with it being too soft . i have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well . def . recommended .
0	as a nursing mother i researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition . i read from so many sources that soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies . i bought a starter kit and several other bottles . i was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that i purchased only one did not leak . i tried repositioning the nipple and i tried to tighten the lid . nothing helped . my son was soaked everytime we tried to use them . i switched to another brand and now we are very dry
1	so far our 7 month old son likes this toy . he watches the flashing lights , listens to the music and noises , and seems to like the different shaped blocks ( we have several other peek-a-boo blocks ) . he uses the handle to push the bus , flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on . it keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time . we thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it did n't flash . well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing . it also made the hood stay shut better . so maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem
1	if they made one of these things for adults , i 'd get one ! ! my daughter loves this thing . it 's got that crinkle-sounding paper that babies seem to love , and spins really easily . the colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands . i have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these
0	now that i have this chair , i 'm not going to replace it but i have two major complaints about it . our son is 20 months old and i still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table . raising the height does n't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you ca n't scoot the chair in any closer to a table . the chair also has a very large footprint -- unless you have a very spacious dining area it 's hard maneuvering around it . if i could do it over again , i would n't buy this high chair
1	our little guy was sleeping comfortably in his stroller for the first several months we brought him home . when we tried to transition him to the crib , he was startled by the large space and would cry or sleep very poorly . as he outgrew the stroller , we tried to think of ways to emulate the coziness of the stroller inside his crib ( lots of attempts - not an easy task ! ! ) . he 's 5 1/2 months old and we now use the sleep nest in the crib as well as putting him in the larger sized swaddleme at night . he loves the closeness and sleeps very soundly . the sleep nest is small enough to be cozy , but large enough for him to move comfortably . it fits very nicely into the crib and is also portable which is great since he enjoys being on the go
0	i have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly . the two main parts , left side board and right side board , both came in totally cracked . when i called in to order replacements , the customer service rep knew exactly what i 'm calling to re-order . ? ! ? ! ? ! if it 's a known problem , why not fix it ? ! the customer service reps are very nice , but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really does n't make this product very attractive . the processing itself takes 2-3 weeks . in my case , 3 weeks later , i found out that my 2 parts are on back-order , awaiting shipment by container from brazil . so it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until i receive it . i hope the dresser arrives before the baby ...
1	this is one of my favorite products i have purchased as a new mommy . i love it . it warms the avent bottles great . it took some trials to determine how much water to add but now i have it down great . you can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful . it is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water . it does not warm the playtex ventair bottles . i guess because of the vent but i preferred the avent bottles anyway . the cooler does keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day . we have a 2 story house and this helped us so much . i have the other first year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well . this is definitly worth the money
1	my son is 5 months old and loves this jumper ! ! ! he can keep himself entertained and i am able to do some things with both hands ! plus , it 's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down , laughing ! i love the tray around it . it 's big enough to set toys on but not get in the way . also , the strap frame at the top makes it so easy to get him in and out . we are going on vacation in a month and this will be making the trip !
0	with our knobs being on the front of the stove , these covers hung down over the oven door , and either got in the way , or were popped off on a regular basis ( or pulled off by our 16 month old ) . we found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop was n't in use
1	i purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old . at first , he seemed a little intimidated by the toys , and would cry when i put him in it . once he got used to it , he really enjoyed it . now he plays with all the toys , and he likes that it wobbles around . his favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads . i did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about . just lucky i guess . the seat is really hard to remove for washing , which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of
0	unfortunately you are correct - these are not the same premium heavyweight cloth diapers that used to come from gerber . when i called the company ( i use these cloth diapers in my business ) to ask , they told me this was the same product . it is not . they quilt and wrinkle after one washing , and just do n't hold up their shape in general . amazon needs to update their site , because the packaging has changed as well . i miss the old diapers !
1	i bought this beacause i needed my gate to be just a little bit wider . it attached very easily and was easy to install . also , it is very hard to find in stores
0	i researched many car seats and settled on this one . safe and cute ! but it has a *major* flaw : the strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat . my daughter , only five months old , was already almost sitting *on* the belt where it comes out . this mean that the buckle was way too low and tight , forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone . i asked around online on some forums , and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons . many mothers did n't find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs , but it was a problem for me already , because we use cloth diapers , so my baby 's butt is bigger due to the 'padding . ' this car seat would n't work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers ... and even otherwise , i ca n't see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so ... the britax roundabout has the croth belt at a different location , a few inches further out from the back of the seat , so it is the one i am getting as a replacement
1	whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler . my grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity . yes , activity . at a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving ; no moving , no peek-a-boos ! it contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby . a good value at any price
0	leaking , slipping , ca n't use over the kitchen sink . horrible design .
1	all rubbery squirt toys have the issue of the black stuff , there 's no avoiding it . we squirt them til empty at the end of every bath . my kids love the net and little fish , as well as the other toys . no problem with paint loss on the net as of yet and we 've had it over 2 years .
1	i have used both this product and the disposable kind that have stickers to keep them on the table , and i like both for different reasons . the disposable ones are sort of expensive , but very portable when i am flying and visiting relatives . the hippo one is great to grab and go around town , when i am not concerned about the weight of my diaper bag . i have had waiters thank me at many restaurants ! just fold the mess right up and clean at home ! my son is way too young to have a plate and not toss it , and i do n't want him eating off of a table that is probably full of nasty germs . this hippo is really durable too , i have used this same mat for over 3 years , ( i first got it for my daughter ) and it still looks great
0	i received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter . i thought it was a wonderful toy , and so did my daughter . after playing a while with it on the floor , my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands , and fell down , and the toy dropped on the floor . at this point the toy started to malfunction . the music would play sometimes and not others . and after being dropped to the floor a couple more times , it stopped working altogether . i think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be . great toy ... but it did n't last long
1	love these . i use them everywhere . i really ca n't imagine not having them , since my son throws down all plates and napkins still .
0	first , i agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby 's sleep better . that i can not deny . our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking . however , the trade off in better sleep is not worth the risk . i woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters . she could have easily suffocated ! this is a very common complaint with this product ( both here on amazon 's web site as well as on target 's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that i had ) . some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product . i have to tell you that that is not quite the case . our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and does n't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated . the bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that does n't explain things either . if you choose to purchase this product , please be very careful with it . i understand that those of you who have infant with reflux do n't really have a choice about this but i recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down . as for us , we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters .
0	this thermometer is totally worthless . it does n't read the correct temp . on myself , husband or baby . when my little one was sick at 3 months old , this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us . i picked up a digital 'under the tongue ' type and simply used it under his arm . works great -- cost me $ 3 . i ca n't give this one away
1	my baby and i just love it ! ! ! ! it is so easy to bath her now and so much fun ! i started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome . she plays with her toys and has tons of fun . the side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax . after her bath , i just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day . i really recommend it , it is super practical . ( please never leave your baby unattended
0	we ordered a tub from baby because which was delivered . then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered . on route the formula fell off a ups truck and was lying in the street for over a day . a neighbor saw it and gave it to us . baby because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it . we expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day . they said it was n't our concern and to just give it back
1	this thing cracks us up ! we ordered the elephant and our one year old absolutely loves it . he can play with it , but its secure enough that he ca n't pull it off . it was also an absolute necessity for us - now that he crawls around the tub during bathtime , it was only a matter of time before he knocked his head on the faucet . it puts our minds at ease while entertaining him at the same time .
0	my 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux ( she does n't vomit , it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn ) . she also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old . they were horrible ! we like the playtex premium nurser and the playtex ventaire ( chubby bottles ) much better . we tried the regular dr. browns , but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast . with both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast ... when i sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes ( @ one ounce with the playtex bottles ) , to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces ! we had a horrible night both times we tried the dr. browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow ( we used the slow flow nipples even ! ) . i also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples ' too-fast-flow ( formula fed baby ) . i highly recommend the playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak . we only tried dr. brown to see if it would alleviate the gerd symptoms - it did not ! ! ! !
1	i am sure this is a good stroller ( that 's why i bought it ! ) my `` review '' is more of a word of caution : this thing takes forever to arrive . do n't be fooled : `` usually ships within 24 hours '' really means `` may ship sometime '' . as of 2/8/06 , our stroller has not arrived . it was ordered january 1 , 2006 . it is not even slated to ship for another week ( we 'll see ... ) . meanwhile , the local store has several in stock . my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion : go to your local store . otherwise , be prepared to wait a very long time .
1	i will say up front that i use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests . the gate is built well ... simple and functional . it has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily . it went up easy and works as designed . it is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue . in a similar vien , you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close . my guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended . overall i would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs
1	i love it ! this is probably one of my most used baby items . it is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean . i 've bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends
1	this stuff works wonders for my son 's sensitive bum ... and fast ! we usually see results in just one application - usually by the next changing the irritaion is gone or nearly so . it also has a very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams . it may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison , but i 've found that i do n't need to use as much , which makes that argument mute
0	we received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago ( i was registered at babies r us ) . my first child used it for a little over 2 years . my second child has used it for nearly 2 years . neither child is big ( in fact , one is rather petite ) . even though the mattress was not abused , it cracked and ripped in numerous places . i 'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty ' policies from kolkraft . i do n't recommend this mattress .
0	i am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors . the battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so i ca n't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery . and it does n't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it . i have to keep it on the charger all night so it does n't go out . there is tons of static and extra noise . also , the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if i bend down to much . just super dissapointed with these monitors - absolutely not worth its big price tag ! ! please look elsewhere - do not recommend !
0	i was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy , they button onto the car seat and it is n't strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off . the are no longer attached to the seats because i refuse to keep putting them back on . i guess this seat is okay , it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat ( which i did n't think about before i purchased this ) was the fact that the kids ca n't fall asleep in these seats . my kids like i am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out . but because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually do n't fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then i worry because i do n't want them to get a crook in their neck . i can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat .
0	i 've contacted the manufacturer ... for an alternative way to hook to crib . they were less than helpful . i am thinking about returning the entire set i 'm so disappointed
0	this seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light . if i were to do this over , i would buy a different infant seat
1	i purchased the sesame beginnings walker and my daughter loves it . there is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself . it also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them . this walker makes noise and lights up . there is n't any paint on her walker and i do n't know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter
1	our $ 10 piece of junk umbrella stroller ( you know the one ) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at harrod 's in london , and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller . turns out it 's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right . you ca n't go wrong . it 's sturdy , well-balanced , super easy to fold up and carry around ( sling it over your shoulder -- it 's that light ) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield ( ours happened to come with a rain cover as well , but this was in london and i do n't know if this us version comes with it automatically ) . the color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness . love it . like many people , with two kids we calculated that we 've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years ( how does that happen ? ! car seats , too ) and this is the best so far . go for it
0	i absolutely agree with this review : `` you will not get your moneys worth ... , february 26 , 2006 '' we bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours . we have the sable color , which i see is not sold this year ... but i digress . we have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it . my biggest complaint is the steering . the front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we 're not on a smooth surface , it feels like i am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they do n't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards . i am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so i can get where i want to go . shopping is a joke with this stroller because i can not get it to navigate the aisles easily . the shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which , really , does n't seem like the best way to keep a child 's shoulders restrained . it ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt . this is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger , this got on my nerves . the adult cup holder is a joke , so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid 's cupholder out so it does n't stay in any longer as well . oh , and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on . so frustrating ! not a big deal , really , but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time . i just remembered also , that the sides of the padding in the seat area , when i used this stroller with our graco snugride car seat , would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely . i would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area ( the parts that say aria ) before i put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly . if peg perego could fix the steering , i think i would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that i found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son
0	i love the idea of this product . like many of the other reviewer 's i do n't have the regular traditional style crib . our crib converts to a toddler bed . this product is based on traditional cribs and only works on those styles of cribs . i would love to use this product to protect my little on when they come out with one 's that are more with the current styles of cribs , like mine 's .
1	i love this stroller , and tell all of my friends about it . our daughter was about 3 months old when i purchased it . there was not a better rated stroller available when i researched , and there still is not . you can run , walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe . lilyana is now 4 1/2 months and loves going for our daily walks , and occasional rollerblading . she is a fussy girl , ( only ) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat , but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of bob . we live in florida , and with the sun-guard canopy , she is well covered . some other factors which made we chose bob : * the braking mechanism , which is hard to find , has a wrist strap which if you should fall , locks the back wheels ( unlike most strollers on the market ) . this feature is great for rollerbladers . * 5 point safety harness * 70 pound weight limit ( highest that i found ) * metal frame ( others have more plastic that metal ) * shock absorbers , great of rocking/bouncing her to sleep * swivel front wheel , which locks with a simple pin . * simple lily likes it , and we tried several others , all that babies-r-us has in stock . the cost is pretty high , but would you put a price on the safety of your child , if you were to fall while exercising ? thanks for hearing me out
0	i like the concept of an elevated design . they should make the sides breathable . i have had my son sleeping on this since he came home . this has been 6 weeks so far . he twitches and moves his legs and arms , and such . typical baby stuff . he ends up slidding down in between the wedges . i tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up . you would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in . he slides no matter what . when i put the towell to high his head slid off the edge . good idea needs work
0	we had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out . called customer service , and they said it is n't a replaceable part . too bad . it was easy enough to install , and worked well up until it did n't anymore . the click is pretty loud ; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby . disappointed it did n't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and i still need a gate at the top of the stairs . i'l be replacing it with a different product , obviously
0	i wanted something thick and soft so my baby could n't feel the plastic under his sheet . this one is so thin you can almost see through it . there is hardly any quilting . another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on . it is a safe fit , and washes well . i ment to give it 3 stars
1	my son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers , he just wont sit in them ; so this product was our solution for him when we are out . it is small , but my son ( 20 months old ) fits fine in it ! the problem is i ca n't find the liners anywhere .
1	to bring the co-sleeper up to the height of the bed , these leg extensions are the best bet . yes , as someone else said , they do make it a little shaky . so if you are not planning to attach the co-sleeper to your bed , you may want to leave the height alone . ( you 'll be getting up anyway , so it probably does n't matter how tall it is . ) but once attached to the bed with the anchor strap , rather than free-standing , it was very secure .
0	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in , but really , it took up too much counter space . i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary , i found . save your money
0	i was really unhappy with this lock . it not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well
0	my neighbor had the nojo and liked it so i was going to get one too . i tried hers , but i could n't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which did n't seem safe and hurt my back . i thought i could order a different size , but found it only comes in one size . i then read all the reviews here and followed someone 's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings . it fit me better ( i 'm petite ) and was a lot easier to use ( and prettier ! ) . i think it makes a big difference to get a sling that 's not bulky and comes in sizes - i do n't get why they use so much padding in the nojo , it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings .
1	out of all the department stores here , i got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph , for the easness . it got noted as lighter and easier to deal with . i secound the so far so good comment earlier.. its comfortable than most seats i have shopped for besides the # 1 britax that i have yet to experience : )
0	i got this as a gift and registered for it for i was pregnant with my daughter . this was the biggest mistake . the canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it . to make it recline , is a chore . my husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up , not to make fun of him . he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out . but even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy . we did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money . well , worth it . i would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good .
1	if your looking for a no frills chair this is the one . i did n't find it terribly difficult to put together but was suprised at how well made the tray and seating area is . i did n't want to spend a whole lot of money on a highchair being the fact that my older kids when they were big enough they would rather sit on a booster seat . it does recline but i keep the seat in the upright for my 6 month old . she seems to like it better that way . the only thing i would complain about is i do n't care for the way the belt is . i may be using it incorrectly ( at least it seems like that ) but it holds the baby ( and that 's what it 's meant for )
0	we ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly . our children are 2.5 and 10 months . our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support . also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield , and peek a boo window cracking , also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric . the kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when my two kids were in it . it cloapsed because the locking system melted ... .. oops , i guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test ! !
1	item is exactly as pictured/described . cute design and good quality . adds a nice touch . highly recommend
0	this monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it . also , it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet ( - from our daughter 's bedroom to the kitchen ) . i would definitely not recommend this product , and had i not lost the receipt , i would have returned it
0	i gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son 's ( 1 year old ) christmas gift and this was one of the items . boy do i regret giving him this as an idea . it is a cheaply constructed toy . the bus 's hood does n't even work correctly . the toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise ! the toy held my son 's attention for less than 5 minutes . my suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one
0	this gate is absolutely worthless . if i could give it zero stars , i would . it was difficult to install and is very flimsy . i have it at the top of the stairs and i do n't trust that it will hold at all . i hate that i spent so much on the gate and now i have to purchase another one .
1	this is the best bed rail if you do not have a box spring . my 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and i purchased this rail because he has a `` bunkie '' board instead of a box spring . the length is satisfactory , and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges . it is easy to make the bed as well . we also purchased it for the grandparent 's house because they have a platform bed . it works equally as well . my only complaint is that maybe the rail is n't high enough but my son has n't been tempted to climb over it . i would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a `` big boy '' bed that does n't have a box spring ( although the manufacturer recommends it )
