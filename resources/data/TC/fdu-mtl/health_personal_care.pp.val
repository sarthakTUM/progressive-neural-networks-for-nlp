1	bumble bumble products are a special `` me '' treat for pampering . the shampoo is mild and keeps my long , permed hair in great shape
0	this item is garbage ; i purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash . sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me , it 's not worth the frustratio
0	i bought this from qvc . it will do the trick for quick touch-ups - not close hair removal , but close enough . unfortunately , mine is barley operating anymore , even with a fresh battery . i 'm not sure why the motor seems to be dying . maybe the life of the trimmer is not that long . as a result , i think it would be better to buy a cheaper one since it should work just as well
0	these bars arrive smashed , melting and stale..taste like cardboard with , dried blueberrie jam spread around on them ... awfu
1	easy on the back and shoulders , as this is very light . it does a good enough surface job until the weekend vaccuuming . my 2 year old daughter loves to use it to help mommy ! i bought this in a drug and discount store for $ 13.95 . it 's worth that
0	i 've used this trimmer only twice , but my initial opinion will lead me to return it . when trimming my moustache , it 's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose . i used it to cut my sons hair , but it kept binding up and pulling his hair . i ultimately gave up and returned to the old oster clippers i have . they buzzed right through with no problem . i 'll be sending this item back
0	it 's quality is cheap and poorly made . i bought two thinking it was a good deal but i threw them out after 2 days because the on/off switch did n't work . it was also very loud
1	this has helped my wife and i to lower our cholesterol . i take it in conjunction with red yeast rice extract ( this must be taken at night ) because my numbers are very high . my wife 's numbers are right on borderline . we took blood tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements . my numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife 's numbers went down about half of mine . ( i also take double the dose she does . ) it 's a great way to keep healthy , naturally . my father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements , also . his dangerous psa numbers ( prostrate ) even dropped radically . we do n't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it was . his dr. said he 'd never seen numbers drop that much . we tell just about everyone we know about it .
0	i paid 50 bucks for a pen that is already leaking on its third day of use . the craftsmanship is shoddy . the packaging itself has nicks on it . the pen is leaking from the silver ring above the first one . i 've had to use scotch tape on it so that it does n't keep staining my fingers . the box says made in china , and well quite frankly , the product seems to be exactly that , made in china . i always thought cross was suppose to be a good brand of pens , but i now know they are n't . the problem for me is i ordered 3 of these pens and one ball point one all at the same time so i could give a few of them away as gifts . what am i going to do now ? this bites
0	this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington before this product gives me nothing but trouble
1	clif bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars i have ever tried . they may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands , but there have been times where i could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price . did n't do a thing for me . wipe it on , let it haze and wipe it off . no difference .
1	i work at a nursing home for the elderly and travel my entire lunch break to take my kindergardener to daycare after school and then pick him up with my two year old to go home , and to know that i have this product at my beck and call . wow ! ! i am a owner of this product for 6 months now and i all i can say is i love it.. so what is requires special water a gallon lasts me for two months so i do n't mind spending $ .75 every two months . i use it in conjunction with my pore cleanser from panasonic and i now i use less make up than ever . i normally wear foundation , pressed powder and loose . now it is just pressed powder . it allows my natural glow to come out and minimized my pores . i do my facial with a towel over my head to intensify the treatment along with a favorite cd and i am on a fifteen minute vacation without leaving home . i take the towel off and my pores are ready for the final stage . i turn on the cool mist and apply a moisturizer at the last minute and i am ready to face another day .
1	i 've used hot air brushes for a couple years . this works better than my last . the low setting and the larger brush works better for me . the high setting blows the hair off the bristles . it 's nice having the small brush option for different styles though . i believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron
1	these batteries work well . they do n't last as long as normal batteries , but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs . if you have kids with toys , these are a must
1	i recieved my product in a reasonable amount of time and i am happy with the product .
1	i mean come on , who needs 5 blades right ? well , after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the mach iii was over a twin head razor , i decided that $ 10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so i took the plunge , and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations . the first thing i noticed was that this new fusion has a more powerful engine than the mach iii . the second thing i found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the mach iii , and with very little effort , and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore . and i find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about . but i do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what i mean . haw haw 5 blade
0	while one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool , the manufacture has indeed done so . the `` spoon '' portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil . i supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility , but instead of using a fastener or weld , its just rolled metal inserted into the coil . after only two uses the `` spoon '' came out of the coil and even though i could easily enough put it back together , after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay . basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now . would recommend buying a more simply designed , single piece shoe horn .
1	it does a great job , i just tought it wound n't let any hair go , but i gess that 's impossible
0	it 's good for its purpose but not resistant . the lock that close the ball broke in the first use when i tried to open . the other one worked fine . it 's a cheap plast material , could be better and more resistant . but for now it 's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras . besides , this product is for medium and small bras . who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the produc
0	i know that this product works for some , but for me it did not . that is why i decided to return it . wahl makes great products , but this product was not for me . my skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it .
0	bought this hoping for a good amount of steam for facials and sinus problems.. hardly any steam comes out and there are too many little pieces and parts . not worth the $ $ at all . i 'm back to boiling a large pot of water for steam
1	i have several of these glasses now . love them . they are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck . i wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one . good price and good product .
1	this is the best invention yet . i could not believe how warm and smooth the cream felt . what a difference from cold cream to warm cream . the cream itself was smoother and yes , buttery ! i love this , this is my best investment yet
1	i 've been using nicads for long , long time and while in some applications the alkaline might last somewhat longer ... the money saved after just a couple of recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash units , gps , walkie-talkie 's , flashlights , etc . however , these newer nimh are just great . no memory shelf and longer current life . nicads and alkaline 4 stars these do get a
0	i was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning cds , yet i was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched . as for scratches , you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you . the solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches . i tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same . multiple applications fared no better . the disc i bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when i started
0	the amount of time resulted in minimal results -- i was very disappointed
1	out of the 3 flavors available , this one is the favorite of both my boys ( 4yrs and 7yrs ) . but no matter what flavor its a snack they both will eat and enjoy !
1	although the compartments seem small , you can fit lots of food into this bowl . it 's divided into about 4 or 5 sections , so you can separate your veggies , meat , etc . the only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break : ( so , i use it to store food in the fridge . i have all of the other fit fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken .
0	absolutely the worst cream ever ! after about a week of using it , my skin turned very red and then gray/brown ! i developed severe wrinkling and my skin became rubbery and loose . i went to a dermatologist who did a biopsy and said that i had developed elastolytic granulomas over the area where the cream was put - the elastin in those areas was destoyed and there was a scarring like pattern of collagen . the normal architecture of the dermal/epidermal junction was also lost - causing melanin from the epidermis to fall into the dermis - basically causing permanent discoloration ! dont listen to the false hype on the net - that hype is coming from people trying to make money off this stuff - take the advice of someone who has actually used this product - copper peptide products are not good for your skin
0	this is the first time in my life i have been inspired to come online and write a review of a product . when i first saw the ad for this on tv , i thought it sounded like just what i needed . i rushed to the store , but it was n't even on sale yet . finally i found it yesterday at walgreen's- and i hate to say- it stinks ! i have just below shoulder length curly hair . i generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- i hate spending a lot of time on my hair . but once in a while i straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush , and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish . i am not very good with a hair dryer , and it takes me a long time and i find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer , and i do n't do a very good job . plus then i need to use the iron too , and it takes me a good 30-45 min total . so i thought this product would be great . all in one ! a time-saver ! easier to use ! well , i was wrong . first of all , it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer . it 's not very powerful . next , it was barely straight ! even on the `` 4 '' setting , there was n't much tension at all . it left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight . so after an hour , i had hair that was not as straight as if i had just dried it alone- and i still needed to use the flatiron . do n't be fooled . it will not give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box . i just hope i can return it . guess i will stick with my chi iron for now . i *might* try the `` long hair '' version of this dryer to see if that 's any better
1	this product rocks , if you are serious about body building this is a must have ... i 've been using no-explode about two weeks and seen some serious enhanchments.. first of my workout lasts at least an hour longer than usual and still have energy left over . combine this product with the right amount of protein shake you are good to go ... also note that this product does not cause any stomach cramping or aching like other creatine products do and tastes great
1	bought this to help make muddy paw print clean up a little quicker . this works well , my better half thinks i have an obsession with mr. swiffer ... : ) it does leave a haze on the floor though . i use the recommended 3 sec . cleaner dispense ... maybe it 's because i do n't change the pads ofter enough . overall , i would purchase the swiffer again if i had too
1	i found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what i want it to and i only paid $ 14.99 for it . it does n't cause my hair to frizz up and it 's easy to style when i take the rollers out . as far as it taking too long to heat up , i do n't really let that affect my review because i plug it in and while it is heating up i do my makeup or something else . ( i 'm a multi-tasker anyway ) i also do n't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair . overall i like it .
1	sedamine is great sleep aid . i 've been dealing with no sleep problems for about 8 months and i tried nearly everything including old remedies-i thought i would go crazy if i did n't find help . not sleeping has been awful . since end of july i started with the sedamine product and it started working right way . i tell anyone to try it cause it help me it help anyone .
1	i bought this model 7 years ago for over $ 100 and it is still running strong although i only use it to clip a small family dog . nevertheless , forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor ' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal . this clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action . in fact , with the right ( replaceable ) blade , you could use this to cut kids hair as well . it stays cool , unlike the magnetic motor design . use with oster kool lube and you will never have problems getting a clean cut . it uses blades by oster so there is a lot of versatility possible
1	i did n't have any trouble with them being too large . i tested them in a battery-operated light string against a no-name , non-rechargeable brand and they lasted almost exactly the same amount of time .
1	i was n't sure what to expect when i 1st tried this two-part microdermabrasion peel kit . i use it twice a week , and what a difference it has made on my skin . the only thing is , i wish they made a bigger bottle of the peel . mariann
1	when my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him . it was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings . then i bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out . just enough to see your baby by , but not enough to keep everyone awake . it 's been almost a year now , and i 'm just about to purchase two more . we use the light now in our toddler 's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine . we use it every night
1	replacement blades are a must . the razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases . but , if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day , as i do , then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so . the reminder on the razor is only a suggestion , not a command . after all , it does not know when the blades get dull . so , i simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when i feel it is necessary . one thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin . until then you may have a little irritation . another problem i have solved is the hair on my neck . i use to think the harder i press the razor , the better it would get those stray hairs . but , all i got was a rash . i discovered that if i simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness . replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you
1	these are the best diapers i have used . they are soft , flexible , and easily adjustable for a good secure fit . they hold leaks extremely well . of course leaks do occur ( why would n't they if your baby has , say for example , 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes ... .it 's happened ) , however this is to be expected . they do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy , but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection . i highly recommend these
1	this would be a perfect curling iron if heated to a slightly higher temperature . it takes a little longer to curl my hair because of the lower temperature
1	i just bought a vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high . i needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet . these goggles are awesome ! they fit perfectly inside my helmet , and because the wrap around my head , they stay put . the magnets in front are very strong so the goggles do n't move . the eye cups are just the right size and they 're padded for comfort . these goggles have far exceeded my expectations .
1	this shaver has met all my expectations . it cleans and recharges itself automatically . the shave is close and nick free . the only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes
1	i 've tried many a serum , potion , lotion , cream ... every over the counter fit-it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had ! i know , iknow ... there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting , but i 've yet to see it
0	upon purchasing this product , i 'd hoped it would be equivilant to the product i normally purchase at the salon . i was horribly disappointed . it was nothing at all like the typical product , rather much more like water . the normal scent was not present , the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long . i would very much like to return this . it 's not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon . i was sorely disappointed
0	i bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son 's fast growing hair . he 's got thick hair that we like to keep `` buzzed '' short . the first time i used the clippers , he complained that they really pull at the hair . i realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair i buzzed . the little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair . i 've decided to send it back . reasonably priced but not worth the pain . not recomended for thick hair
1	after reading other reviews on air mattresses i was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed . but it 's been over 2 months and so far so good . i sleep on it every night , ( i 'm buying a real bed when i move in june ) and it is holding up
1	this is 100 percent plastic , makes me nervous dealing with it . the variable sprays are nice , one is so wide it shoots outside the shower . make sure you crank on this when fixing it to the water pipe . i really had to tighten it to keep it from leaking . one other reader snapped hers on the install , i was afraid the same would happen . it is a good shower head , not great
0	after some research online , i decided to purchase this dryer because it had all the qualities i was looking for in a lightweight , compact model . it worked great while it lasted , but unfortunately it died 6 months after purchasing it . one day it worked , and the next day it started smoking and sparking ! !
0	pull ups are not very good for potty training , they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom . potty training does not include using diapers . that is what these are is fancy diapers . if you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them . the wetness liner is a joke . these also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants
0	it does let you shake and mix up the protein well . but no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads . then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere . it 's a horribly cheap and leaky design . i would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it . ( and if you find a good one that does n't leak please post the info here and let me know ) . thanks
1	i bought this item because i was going to europe for a month . i did n't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time , unless you buy more than one converter kit . you do need a plug adaptor , ( these are relatively inexpensive ) , then you just switch the voltage , plug it in and it works great . i used it in switzerland , france and italy . when i came home to the states i just switched the voltage back and i now use it at home . it is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase . i would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad
1	i absolutely love this little book light . it is so slim and easy to store , plus i can use it for my magazines and paperbacks . i highly recommend this item . a++
0	the only thing that i have really used out of it has been the nail clippers . otherwise , i wasted the money on it and could have put it towards something more useful . well , i guess you and learn . it was my first baby , everything looks great and needed
1	this contains 16 servings , which means it will last you half a month . that 's pretty expensive when you break the price down by serving and whne compared with a 1 month supply of the flax capsules that costs $ 7 . however , liquid flax oil is a lot more concentrated than the pills you buy at the store . a flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg of flaxseed oil and a suggested dosage of 2-3 times a day . so with pills you 're getting 2-3g of flax oil a day . with liquid flax oil , you 're getting 14g of flax . if you are buying this for it 's purported treatment of acne , sunburn , diverticular disorders , hemorrhoids , and more serious health conerns , it 's probably best to consume the liquid flax oil . if you just want the benefits of lower cholesterol and heart disease prevention , a pill a few times a day , combined with fish oil should be all you need . it 's definitely easier though to take a spoonful of this in the morning than 3 flax pills a day , and when you loook at value , you 're getting 224g of flax oil in this bottle when compared with a typical 100g in a 100 pill bottle of the capsules . it all depends on what you need it for
0	what a disappointment ! the device just was n't predictable . sometimes it would do as expected , sometimes not . it was just a crapshoot . finally unplugged it and it 's in a drawer somewhere . yes , i played with the sensitivity with no success . getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince the clapper to do its thing . save your money and look elsewhere
1	recently got my sleepmate and it is very effective . somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom , and i do n't have any trouble sleeping . i use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night , and have the hardest time getting back to sleep . i hardly ever wake up at all now . great product , and i 'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night 's sleep
0	was impressed by the attachments and the how-to video but the clippers were of poor quality and pulled on hair rather than cutting it . my 5 year old was in tears within 30 seconds of use . i returned mine for a refund . make sure you test clippers before buying i
0	babyliss pro instant heat 5 jumbo roller hairsetter comes in a compact , useful size . however , the rollers take a long time to heat up . even if left plugged in for a half-hour , they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair . i would not recommend this product
0	this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet , so i bought this specifically for that use . i used the triangular pumice attachment only.i was under the impression that the attachment would rotate , but in general it 's just a vibrating ( 2 levels ) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually . the vibrations were n't intense enough to make any difference . the actual machine has no function . the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine
1	this is a great product . a friend told me about it . i finally decided to get one . i had bleeding gums . in two weeks of regular use , bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great . just be careful when using the water jet side . you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth , or it will spray all over the place :
1	i ordered this walker for my father a few months ago and am well-pleased . it is much less expensive than comparable walkers . the cushioned seat and basket are handy for long `` trips '' and the wheels roll smoothly even over grassy areas . a good buy for someone looking for a quality walker . even ships for free
1	i have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down . as other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base . it makes dry shaving extremely smooth , as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess . you can use this with any type of electric , not just remingtons , and it 's very easy to clean out , just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush . highly recommende
0	i ordered the regular size , they were to big , the smaller size ? too small . neither one fit well but both did one thing well , hurt the area under my eyes . buyer beware
0	i was looking to scent an entire room . the lavender is a decent aroma but you need to be within a foot . there were no recommendations on how to spread the scent throughout the entire room so i have to believe that this limited range is normal
0	the self cleaning concept was the reason i bought this razor . the razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad . after owning the razor for two months i noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after i had just refilled the fluid . after a closer inspection i found out that the fluid had leaked out all over , and this fluid destroys everything it touches that is n't metal or plastic . i thought maybe i had done something to cause the problem so i refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process . immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together . it is now headed to the landfill . the trimmer does not work well either
0	contrary to purported performance claims , my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of duracell 's products . decades of experience with everready energizers - and with other duracell products ( e.g. , coppertops ) - show procell products to be markedly inferior in performance . regardless of how long their shelf life may be , they simply have n't performed up to par , much less equally to other alkaline batteries . this has just been my experience - over daily use , over many months , with set after set of procell aa batteries . take it for what its ' worth
1	this was sent to my daughter and son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit . i had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up . they love it ! ! ! not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap , shampoo , etc. , my son-in-law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well
1	i am in my early 30 's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line , chin and cheeks for the past couple of years . i have tried murad , proactiv , acnefree and many other systems without success . a month ago i picked up the neutrogena system when i saw it on sale . within five days days my skin started to clear . now , i have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system . i have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before . finally , a product that works and comes at a decent price !
0	expensive ... and after three months of daily use i ca n't say it has helped my blood pressure . i record my blood pressure every morning at the same time ... after getting up from nights sleep . i use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises . then breakfast and 15 minutes on resperate devise . my blood pressure has n't changed significently in the last six months and i continue to take blood pressure medicine . the resperate device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule has n't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent . i continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but would n't consider buying it again
1	when i do n't eat as many veggies as i should these are easy to take
0	i purchased this unit and was dissatisfied with comparisons i made at the doctor 's office . i next purchased an omron arm unit and found the results to be more valid and reliable . the wrist unit is very cool , but did not live up to consumer reports suggestion that it had acceptable validity . i 'm technically savvy , an excellent instructions follower , and really wanted to like this unit , but i can not recommend it . skip the cool wrist unit and get an arm unit if at all possible .
1	my daughter morgane , who is now 8 years old , has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy ( yes , there is such a thing , unfortunately ) . the symptoms are very impressive , she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes . she can not move or open her eyes . it makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to `` get dizzy '' . we tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down , to no avail . morgane 's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines , and we try to avoid giving morgane medication as she is so young . so i thought of using resperate as my dad has high-blood pressure and i knew it worked on the breathing pattern . morgane immediately understood how to use the device , it was so easy and even fun for her . it relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines . her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far , she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months . she used to have them every two months . i have purchased another device for my best friend , a long time migraine sufferer . the way i see it , it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing
1	i am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of clics i own . if you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect . their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on ! i 'd look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer . lastly ~ i 've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use
0	not really an improvement over standard mach 3 cartridges , and certainly not worth the price jump . the shave quality still does not match that by an `` old-fashioned '' safety razor
1	i have used this twice a day and love it . best buy at this price
1	definitely the best heating pad i 've ever experienced . i 'll never buy any other kind of heating pad again . this is by far the best and well worth the money . i love that it can set the temperature precisely and much higher than any other heating pads i 've ever seen ( that only have `` high medium and low '' settings , and usually the high and medium settings cause burns , or do n't get hot enough , or go from barely any heat to burning ! ) this heating pad 's lcd shows the actual temperature it 's at , which is great . and yes it feels very moist , but not like you 're getting dampness on your clothing . my only complaint is that it shuts off after 60 minutes . i could easily have this on all day :
0	ewww ewww get it off get it off ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! omigod i loved hugo so much i 've been anticipating this in the mail and bought the shower gel from a different source as well . this is just terrible . i 'm taking a shower . look for my posting of this cheap ... i 've already taken a loss . i have reviewed many colognes , take a look at them . i like most of them
0	i ordered one and had it arrive totally broken . amazon sent a replacement . that too was defective . save your time/money and buy another , maybe in person . i 'm not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping . ( amazon is giving me a refund including shipping , so there 's not a problem there .
0	the monitor works really well . the functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking . if you are looking for a good basic monitor , this is a great unit .
0	i purchase this press , and was totally disappointed with this product . it takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press , than with an iron . i will be returning
1	great features ! probably the best pedometer out there for the money . the only reason i give 4 vice 5 stars , is that i think the one i bought for my mom ( same brand and model ) is slightly more accurate . a great way to track your fitness overall
0	if you 're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes , this thing works acceptably well , but if you 're mixing something like `` ionic fizz '' magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit , it 's not very useful because it just does n't form a very good seal , no matter how tightly you close it . as another reviewer mentioned , it 's very easy to cross-thread the lid . thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help . it is great for sipping though , and easy enough to keep clean . but i went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it . the seal on this bottle is too flaky because it 's difficult to tell if you 've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it . i 'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has . i do n't use this any more , because it 's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading . do n't waste your money on it .
0	this hair dryer did dry my hair quickly . but , it quit working after a month . i exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later . the buttons were also hard to switch . this was a waste of money . i ended up buying a completely different hair dryer
1	these are a helpful item for me ; the cloth pockets are nice , and the instructions for microwaving are clear and simple
0	unfortunately , this is poorly designed . it is too high to rest you wrist on comfortably and the 'stimulating ' rolling rubber parts are too hard and abrasive
0	it worked fine for 2 -3 weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my short hair and it would just stop . i had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again . gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together . very frustrating . go get a professional dryer . it might cost a bit more but it 'll work ! and probably for a long time
1	this is the best dispenser we have used . it attches to the wall easily , is eay to fill and is constructed in such a way that it has multiple uses . we purchased smaller ones to give as gifts-knowing others would like it also .
0	the item pictured here is not what you will receive . you will receive a different model that has a different external and possibly internal design . most important is that the model you get will not have the little orange change filter indicator . this very important feature takes the guess-work out of when to change the filter . do n't buy this item from this seller if you expect to get what is pictured . thanks , pj-berk
1	we have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great ! when it changes color all i do is plug it in for about 10-12 hours and then hang it back up again ! we are very satisfied
1	this is a fine , well lasting bar of soup that smells like sweet oranges -- you will catch wiffs of the very pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom . it reminds me of tangerine lifesavers , if that helps . it 's a big bar , too , the dimensions of the bar are , in inches : 4 x 2.5 and 1.5 thick
1	the clippers are excellent quality and cut well . we have a poodle that has very thick hair . if you take your time , these clippers do a wonderful job
1	this was almost too strong for me at first . i put it on the lower level of the house and it took away that `` basement '' smell for months . i was impressed with the `` throw '' this thing had . i would definitely repurchase .
0	order this item only if you do not need to use it immediately and can wait for a long time . i do not know how long because i am still waiting
1	27 ounces is a nice size , the bottle is light ( can be dented ) , and water stored in it tastes very good ... .and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy ! another reviewer mentioned a squeal ... ... that would be while twisting the cap on or off . i 've gotten used to that . wish it was just a hair thinner to fit in my toyota cupholder ... that may not be an issue with toyotas that are newer than mine are ( 10 15years ) . in the car , on the nightstand , in the canoe or kayak ... ..it 's working for me
0	the mirror did not work , the lights and clock did not work and i did contact the seller who told me to send it back but since the mirror had been taken out of the box and the box was totally messed up , i would have to get a new box and take it to the ups place to send it which would have cost me about another $ 10 and quite frankly , it was just not worth the time nor the money
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them . i am very disappointed . the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky . it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste . it 's very hard to clean . it 's loud , and small brush . not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive . no thank you
0	this thing does n't massage , just vibrate , and two of the motors died quickly . although the product is supposed to be covered by 2 year warrenty , the customer service is non-existent . stay away from this , definitely not worth the money
1	my husband and i love this thermometer for our own use - let alone the grandkids ! it 's fast , easy , and reliable . highly recommend it
0	i personally have not taken this diet pill ; however i am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt `` trippy '' `` weird '' and `` out of sorts '' . britney spears had been taking this stuff for a while ... then as we all know she went all `` postal '' , shaved her head , attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and did n't return ... ..and we wonder why she did it ... hummmm ... none the less , the side effects like those reported i 've seen personally from close friends . they should re-name this diet pill asylum-x , because that 's where you 'll be . diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids , and i do n't know about you but i 'm not comfortable with something altering my state of being ... .just something for you to `` swallow ''
1	i have had this straightener for a while , and i still have no complaints about it . it is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener . i love the heat settings ... i only need to put mine on the second setting ( 338 degrees ) for it to do a good job , and i have very thick wavy/curly hair . i like the 1 '' because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair , but i 'm sure the 2 '' one is great too
0	i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years . this new model er430k is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement . it 's nice and quiet , and i 'm sure the vacuum works great , but i would n't know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim . we 're talking about hairs easily 1/4 '' in length . a trimmer should be able to shave those down , do n't you think ? if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors . do n't bother even trying this product , it 's a waste of money
0	the battery life is the worst of any electric razor i 've ever used . the razor does n't provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses . the razor is very cheaply constructed and i would not recommend this to anyone . you 're better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine
0	i bought this product b/c i ca n't stand the feeling of hair/stubble on my legs . i got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave . this product indicated i could remove hair in about the same amount of time , but that it would last much longer than shaving . i purchased it and waited a week to receive it . once i received it , i spent 40 minutes using it . in this time , i could have shaved both legs , both underarms , and my bikini line twice . using this product , i was not even done with one leg . i went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period , and it did not remove a single hair . i pressed lightly , i pressed hard , i did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach , and nothing made this product work as indicated . others may have had luck with it , but i did not . i was not impressed and i would not recommend it to anyone .
1	i bought this for my aged mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel i 'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle . she *adores* the microfiber towels i got her ! they are light for her weak arms , they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that 's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly . not to mention that i , a hearty creature in my prime , love these towels too ! i shall be buying more of various styles and colors
0	i bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair , when it gets hot it would stop . good thing i did n't throw it away . this cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months . it is also very loud ! almost hurt my ears to use i
1	the mirror is great . i use it for shaving my face and it fits the bill perfectly . both the normal and 5x mirrors are nice and clear
1	they are a nice compact size for travel . they work as advertised , just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated `` quick curl '' time
0	my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles -- shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur
0	sorry to say , but this product did not work as promised . the black canister does not hold any type or brand of lather can , only gel type cans . i did call the customer service number and asked why this is , and the rep told me that it is a type - o on the package . in order to use with a lather can , you just put the device on the top of the can and use as is . the older model product did fit the lather type cans , but this one does not . sorry but if you are going to use this with a lather can , you might want to get the older white model . the product looks starange when you cant use the black canister as pictured .
1	i use these glasses all the time at work . they sure are handy . glad i bought them
0	i am on my second zadro led lighted fogless mirror - yes , customer service was decent and they sent me a new one . however , the initial problem was repeated plus some -- it fogs up despite following directions , using their spray , and using words i shoul n't repeat here . additionally , the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months . one good thing is that suction cups still hold it up as long as i press them in every week . this product has problems which make a mockery of its `` zfogless '' claim . save yourself the trouble -- do n't buy it
1	i bought this for my father-in-law who had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old . my mother-in-law at sixty seven , does n't have a lot of arm and shoulder strength and can not wield a full-size wheelchair around and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota camry . the light weight of this chair works great for short trips to appointments . i would n't recommend it for a long day shopping at the mall however . it 's not as easy to use as a full-size standard wheelchair . this is a great chair for shorter trips and appointments to make transferring easier to manage
0	this will require a large mitten in colder weather . this does not appear to use electrical impulse . this will require more adapting to than you might think . when working , it is accurate .
1	i bought this razor over a year ago , and i would n't trade it in for any other razor out there . it really does leave your skin super smooth . i love the triple blades on it so i know i can get a close , comfortable shave , even in hard to reach places . thanks to the pivoting head , it moves with the curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut . it 's also excellent for shaving the underarm area . i find that one stroke is all it takes , and you have a smooth appearance you have to feel and see to believe . this is truly a remarkable product for the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day , or more than three times a week . with this razor , it shaves so close to the hair follicle , you will be shaving in less time , less often . i will never part with my venus razor . the best part is - it 's a bargain for what you get !
0	i 've read a lot of reviews on this product . it obviously works for some people , but be aware it does n't work for everyone . me being one of the latter . i 've taken it twice and both times it did nothing . first time i took it before i left for work . the drive to work i was yawning and about to fall asleep . i did n't get 5 minutes of energy let alone 5 hours . second time i took it was about 15 minutes ago . still nothing . i was feeling sleepy and still am . my mom , on the other hand , says it makes her energetic as hell . it might work for you . it might not , but 5 dollars ( 2 pack was all they had ) is a lot to waste to find out .
0	do n't bother with these . i am a school nurse , and not just this brand , but most brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent , especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal . i had to use the ear type for 8 years between pediatric icu and school nursing . i got pretty good at getting consistent readings , except on very small ear canals , and those with a lot of wax . we got rid of ours and went with an exergen temporalscanner temporal artery thermometer . it takes less time , does n't require probes , and you can get one at costco for $ 30
0	the pins for the curlers are awkward and hard to use . i do n't like them
0	i purchased the waterpik na-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment , expecting it to work with the waterpik professional ultra dental water jet , since that is what was advertised . they do n't fit in this model , so do n't waste your time purchasing both together ! the sinus attachments are too short , so they ca n't `` click '' into the water pik . the end result : water leaks out , and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment . i had to return both items since the amazon rep could n't find any sinus attachment to work in the waterpik ultra model . it 's a shame because i love the small footprint of the waterpik ultra , and it comes with a lot of cool attachments . hopefully waterpik will come up with something in the near future
1	i ordered this parfum because it is really cheap . i received it 4 days after ordering , delivered very fast . the flavor is very nice , make me feel comfortable
0	bought it and it worked for like a month . now it just sits in my room doing nothing . i am going to look for the company information and try to get my money back . if you are going to get a shower mirror pay a little more and get quality
1	i was skeptical about buying this at first , but after seeing it in allure , and reading the various reviews on amazon , i decided to try it . i have to say , i was pleasantly surprised ; it does what it says . it wo n't work on cyctic acne or if the pimple has already come to a head . it does work on pimples that are just beginning.. those hard , tender knots deep under your skin you just know are going to be huge in a day or two . i 've used it on two pimples that were red bumps , and both were mostly gone within 24 hours . completely gone in less than 3 days . usually it would have taken 7-10 days for them to go away , and it would have been ugly
0	do n't waste your money on this size . go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel . the absorbency is good but there 's no way it will fit around a head . also , i 'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either
1	shavers fall into two categories , those who prefer rotaries like the norelco and those who prefer foil shavers . for those of you who like foil shavers , this is the one for you ! i 've owned the latest braun 8985 and it was excellent , while it lasted ... the charger kept breaking on me ( once in the first month [ 11/2006 ] , then another time 4 months later [ 3/2007 ] ) . it was expensive , and the refills were a pain , pricey , but they worked . after two exchanges i decided to try the norelco 8140xl ( speed xl ) rotaries , and while they shaved really close , they tore up my neck . the problem only got worse . returned 3 weeks later . i just got the panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors . they shave much faster than the braun and norelcos . i 'm not sure if i like the `` side to side '' pivoting head , only time will tell . the heads do n't pivot up and down as much as the braun , but once again , time will tell if this is necessary . one major advantage is that it cleans with soap and water ... no expensive refills to hassle over . the panasonic has two noticeable downsides : 1 . it 's louder than other shavers , but who cares ? it shaves incredibly fast anyway . 2 . you ca n't plug it in and shave ... you have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on . this is my favorite razor by far .
1	i 've had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem . sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works . never falls apart and cut hair great . i 'd buy another if this one would ever wear out !
1	they had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and i stayed at and i fell in love with it ! i had to have one of my own and thanks to amazon i was able to find one . this is an excellent product . my husband installed it easily and i would never be without one again . one side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good , lol , and eyelining is a breeze . though he would never admit it , my husband uses also ( trimming mustash , nose hairs ( eewww ) , shaving , etc . ) great product . order one . you will not be dissapointed !
1	i had bought a tingler elsewhere for $ 20 , plus shipping , so when i saw this one advertised for $ 9 , i was a bit hesitant that it was n't the real tingler , but a cheap knock-off ( especially since they show no picture ) . but , i decided to risk it and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is not only the real tingler , it is also shipped in a pretty velvet pouch for wonderful gift-giving . amazon , of course , also offers free shipping for $ 25 or more , so i bought 3 and got them all shipped free ! great deal ! and , by the way , it is incredible ! it really did send little shivers down my spine the first few times i used it . while you sort of get used to the feeling after a while and the little shivers may disappear , it still feels fabulous on your head
1	great tasting bar . nice and soft make it easy to eat
1	this writting instrument is superb in it 's ability to compensate the energetic writer
1	over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs . at age 70 those needs are many . after approximately two rounds of trying , it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general
0	our first unit lasted about almost 2 months . despite the relatively short lifespan , i thought the product was worth it considering the dirt-cheap price . however , the second unit we got leaked water at the base during its first use ; so , it went back to amazon the very same day it arrived our home . this product is so dangerous . without exercising some safety precaution , it can cause electrocution !
0	in my experience with this product , i had no significant hair growth . very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it , and the amount of pills you have to take daily ( ugh ! ) . however , i gave it a two because while it did n't grow my hair , it did change the texture of it . my natural hair is very coarse , and while using the hf37 it became really soft , silky and manageable . nice , if that 's what you 're looking for a hair vitamin to do . but as far as hair growth ... absolutely not recommending hf37 for that
0	i order it on july 14th , but i still have to wait for more than a month to get it .
0	i was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed , because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it
1	unbeatable for the price ! worked fine right out of the box . easy to use and easy to understand instructions . i 'm glad i bought it
0	i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight . this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out . not only did it not work for anything , it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass . also , it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener . needless to say , i 'll be taking this back for an exchange . i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair
0	first , ou can barely tell this product makes a change in humidity levels in the room . secondly , it is extremely noisy and interferes with baby monitor
0	we bought this at suggestion of our dentist . however , it is difficult to use , extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press . we used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience . our neighbors bought the same model , tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave . save your money and go back to flossing !
1	this is the best shaver i have found during 25 to 30 years of electric shaving
0	item does not look any thing like the picture . it is flat . i do n't feel any difference when i am setting for long periods of time
0	like everyone else has said - the controls on this dryer suck ! if your fingers are at all wet or greasy from product , it is a struggle to flip the switches . i do n't know if the ionic feature did anything or not . i suppose i 'll know once i compare it to the replacement i 'm about to buy . i had the dryer for about a year ... and now it 's gone . as i was drying my hair last week i noticed sparks shooting out of the nozzle ! yikes . i cleaned out the filter and the sparks stopped . it lasted maybe 3 more uses before it just went dead . no smoke , no fires , just nothing . i expect a longer life from a simple appliance like this . back to target i go..
1	this is a great value - probably one of the best shower heads i 've used . yes - there are better ones for $ 100+ , but this is absolutely amazing
1	i 've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years , both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation , and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed
1	the product was a gift for my mother who needs extra circulation in her feet . she loves it and it has helped increase the circulation
1	i received this chair very quickly , even though it was close to christmas . the chair was wonderful ! such a great price for such a great chair
1	saved my love life , literally . it worked for me in a couple days and though its a tad pricey well worth the money , doesnt burn or sting either . if only all other stuff i used worked this good i coulda had a date to the prom . cause i tried everything . thanks princereign
1	what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips
0	this product is worthless . save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else . i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank . i 'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in
0	i originally planned to purchase locin floss to replace the dentek , but i 'm not too pleased with it so far . pluses ======= -each individually wrapped floss . -does n't contain floride . minuses ======= -flimpsy handle -- almost not usable . -wrap is not 100 % sealed . -flossing head is shallower and narrower than the dentek
0	tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient `` acetaminophen '' . acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain , making it a great headache reliever , or a medication that treats mild strains , sprains , toothaches , etc . it also acts to reduce fever . acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin . one drawback of acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation ( therefore , it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction ) . it has few side-effects . those with liver disease should avoid acetaminophen , as it is hard on the liver . tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of reye 's syndrome and aspirin in children . tylenol is the manufacturer 's proprietary name for acetaminophen . there is a generic form of acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter , and this version is much cheaper than `` tylenol '' , and the container usually contains more tablets/pills , etc . the generic form of acetaminophen is just as effective as tylenol , just cheaper priced . sometimes acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action . for example , tylenol pm has diphenhydramine ( the active ingredient in benadryl ) , which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill . diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine , so it work for itching and allergies too . tylenol is packaged in different strengths : extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet , standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) , and children 's dose of 80 mg. tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version , called `` extended release '' . rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach , the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract . all in all , acetaminophen is a great product . if you want a `` name brand '' of acetaminophen , tylenol is your brand ( although it will cost more ) . my choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen . jim `` konedog '' koenig
0	would have been better if i actually got this.. i ordered this and got 6 dr. bronner 's lavender soap with a hemp tree soap bar code on the back . i 'm too lazy to send back and i already opened one and the lavender is nice . but i would rather have the hemp tree ... afraid to order again
0	after one year of owning this scale i replaced the batteries and it stopped working
0	this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best . when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0. the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs . give or take a few from clothes ... i was extremely shocked ! how could i weigh that much ! ! turns out the scale was off approx . 20 pounds 20 pounds !
1	this was bought as a gift for my dad , who has limited mobility . it 's easy for him to use , easy to handle and gives him a great shave . he really likes it
1	great help in dental hygene , gets in hard to reach spots , also a lot easier than flossin
0	i am a big fan of the regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs and think they are great . however , the sport goggles do not get my vote of confidence . they have three problems which make them unusable for me : 1 ) on all clic products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head . however , unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by clic , the sport googles do not adjust properly and so the goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there is also extra foam padding on the sport googles that make them very snug , but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3 ) the maker does n't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the irridium ( red ) colored lens on some of the sports goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path . sorry clic , but your success with the reading glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the sports goggles . i would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me !
1	if you wonder why you 're feeling lethargic or if you have one of those little abdominal paunches you thought was just advancing age , then you might need probiotic therapy . you might even need it if your resistance to colds is low ! because we live much `` cleaner '' lives than our ancestors did , sterilizing our dishes , putting our food in the fridge , and spraying pesticides on everything , we live our lives virtually bacteria-free . free of the good bacteria , that is . the baddies seem to still get us , and without the good ones to balance them out , we 're in trouble . a lack of friendly bacteria in your intestines can cause problems throughout your body . to put it in `` nice '' terms , it 's a little like having backed up plumbing inside you , and the world just ai n't gon na be right until you fix it . i started on probiotic therapy several months ago , and i was amazed at the following things that happened almost immediately : *that little stomach paunch went away . i kid you not . talk about an instant self-esteem booster . *my chronic [ men , cover your ears ] yeast infections decreased dramatically ( even without my eliminating wheat from my diet , which i know i ought to do ) . *i had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago . *i became more resistant to colds than i used to be . if you 're considering supplementing your diet with probiotics , you should know that not all of them are created equal . in fact , testing done by www.consumerlab.com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic supplements do n't deliver the number of live organisms they claim -- not even close ! those little creatures are very delicate , and things like processing , shipping , and sitting on your shelf can kill them . and let 's not even talk about what your stomach acid does to them . primal defense is one of the few supplements that delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to . ( i can tell from its effects on me . ) in addition , it contains lots of good-for-you green foods that also help build that all-important inner strength . one very important caveat about primal defense , though : because it 's so effective , do n't even think about starting out taking 3 tablets a day ! not unless you do n't mind a lot of abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by yourself at home . i took one a day for about 2 months , and then i finally felt ready to move up to 2 . it 'll be at least another month before i 'm up to the recommended 3 . one more thing : drink lots of water . you need it anyway , and primal defense works best when you 're well hydrated
0	after a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine , i purchased this scale . on the unit i received , the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs . the scale i was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit . i have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone . i wanted to see if i was having an impact on body fat so i purchased this scale . when i attempt to use this scale , it errors out with the ol code . perhaps the magazine should retract another article
0	i had to return my recent purchase due to a defect . i have used waterpik dental water jets for many , many years and typically have to replace every two or three years . i was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet . i purchased the waterpik ultra , and i am pleased with the design , size and operation thus far . i just hope waterpik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service
