1	it 's a quality product from krups which gives lots of froth ! sometimes too much . if you are not experienced capuchino maker this product is right for you
1	very satisfied with the system . makes water tastes go away . water should not have a taste at all and brita makes it that way
1	great for the money . feel like expensive sheet . very happy with it . just hope it is available with other colors
0	do not be tricked into buying an `` easy '' sharpener . they do not work . spend the same money ( or less ! ) on a good stone set that has various angles ( i.e . lansky , w/ 17 , 20 , 25 , and 30 degree angles , and 3-5 stones : use 20 degrees for your `` slicing '' and paring knives , and 25 degrees for you chefs ) . i opted for the stone set ( i 'm a bit of a purist ) , but i 've heard good remarks about the diamond set , too ; the 3 grit set is all you really need : coarse , medium , and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such . with proper care , and light steel use ( it 's the re-aligning tool , not the sharpening device - be gentle ) , you 'll probably only need to touch-up your edge once every year or two , depending on the work load you put on your knife . but , if you do seriously muck the edge up , you 'll have a system that can repair your knife to `` good as new '' condition . my chef fell onto the tile floor , point first , and i had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later . the normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade . and , at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened , you 'll be ahead of the game after the first use ! hint : use a 5x+ magnifying glass/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source , you 'll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened . you can also take a look at your edge before using the steel , and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it , then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel . and , see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives - i admit i have a couple , myself . in short : get stoned , not taken
0	worst set of sheets i 've ever owned . washed them , and put them on the bed directly out of the drier : the fitted sheet ripped at two different corners
0	i purchased four of these pillows ! i really should n't have wasted my money . they fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up , i 'd rather sleep without a pillow at all ! !
1	this food processor is the most powerful and quietest that i have ever used . i am very impressed with the material the bowl and lid are made of . the ones i have been using for the last 15 years have not been comparable in the least
0	i have watched emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter . i just dismissed it as part of emeril 's shtick until i bought this machine for myself . the first time i tried to use it with any liquid ingredients ( making mayonnaise ) , it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl . the top is just flawed in its design , as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl . i suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that ka did , much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews ( e. g. consumer reports and cook 's illustrated ) . in any case , this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry ( they blow through the badly designed joint as well ) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter , the outside of the bowl , the bottom of the machine , and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do . i will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the cuisinart i have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard .
0	i purchased this set of spoons because they are narrow and can fit into any number of spice jars . i also wanted them because they are hinged and nest inside of each other take up little space . after first use , the pin fell out and the spoons became unhinged . i tried to reassemble and the pin keeps falling out - would n't recommend
1	i bought two of these beds for when my grands visist . it is wonderful . since then i have had several adults utilize the bed and all have said they will buy one . it was like sleeping on a water bed only better and it is level like a bed . grea
1	this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there . the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup , eliminating the scoop step . it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate , along with cup amounts . the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on , however . anyways , bottom line : it grinds great with little mess .
1	these are nice quality sheets but i was a little disappointed..i was expecting them to feel more satiny .
0	the set is lovely and coordinates perfectly with my ocr china set . the box is also beautiful . i wish they 'd give you a diagram for placement of the flatware in the box for those of us who are first-timers .
1	i overheard a flight attendant raving about the neckbones and also saw it reviewed highly in shape magazine . i still have not tried it in the car or on a flight , but am excited to . it does feel comfortable , though is bigger than expected , so pay attention to the dimensions before you buy
1	i really like these glasses . they are attractive and pleasant to hold . i prefer having a wine glass that does n't contain a lot of wine - which is why i got these since they are the smallest in this line
0	loose shape and becomes literally towels within 3 months of use . total waste of money and shipping
0	i almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it 's extremely poor design . mr. coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers . first of all , the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it . this could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless , it 's a filter , it 's supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water . so before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow i would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate . after the entire brewing cycle i would pull the carafe out and there would be no coffee in the carafe . after realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it . the coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly . otherwise , the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter , clogging the drain and then voila , you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty , grainy water all over your counters . i do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason . get the hamilton beach stay or go 45234
0	i bought this belgiam waffle maker 30 days ago . it worked fine for 30 days and then the iron stopped heating up . i contacted villaware and they suggested getting amazon.com to replace the unit which they did . time will tell on the replacement
0	first off , this is available at the ewins site for $ 30 , should you decide to plunge . the construction of the wooden parts is pretty nice , better than what you 'd expect for $ 50 , but that 's about the only positive thing . the hardware is terrible and they only ship as many as you `` need '' , so you 're kind of sol when the crappy aluminum cams break . i 'm sure they 'd send some more if i asked , but for now my piece is hanging out , half way assembled because i 'm scared of breaking any more of the hardware . either way , i think i 'm going to ditch the cam/bolt paradigm and use wood glue and screws to finish it up . the instructions consist of an exploded diagram that looks like it was blown up from an image on the web . if you 've never built flat pack furniture before you will not be able to figure it out . even if you have , you will put something together incorrectly and have to disassemble the piece
0	this towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low -- one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric ( like dust-bunnies ) formed on it too . perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag , but not in one 's bathroom
0	i just purchased this vacuum this morning and vacuumed the entire house ... and now i am afraid that i have to return it back to the store . it sucks wonderfully , do n't get me wrong . the reason why it 's got to be returned to targetland is because of 1. the noise 2. the `dust that flies out of the dust cup when you 're emptying it . the noise is certainly the loudest i 've ever heard on a vacuum cleaner . but , i thought , hey , that 's okay if you want to be noisy ... until i ventured into cleaning the stairs . there 's not much of an extension between the cleaning wand/brush and the actual machine , so while i was bending over to suck up hair and debris ( what have you ) from the stairs ' carpet , i had the crazy noise blasting `` turbo '' -style directly into my ear . ( this was done 15 minutes ago , and my ear still hurts ) . the other problem i 've found with the vacuum is the point that while emptying the dust cup , i am having to actually touch dirt and dust ( the entire outside of the cup is coated with it ) . while pouring the dirt into the trash can , a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor ... nasty and what 's the point in the dust cup if this happens ? i had a eureka spin brush vacuum contraption most recently ( it died after 2 1/2 years ) and i know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup , nor falling to the floor . so , alas , my friends , i must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store . mayhaps , i 'll have luck with a vacuum cleaner that uses bags ( you know , the old-fashioned kind )
0	i am becoming steadily more disillusioned with the kitchenaid brand . this blender is only one of several ka appliances i have purchased that only lasted about a year . i do n't use a blender much , maybe once a month , so when this died after only eleven months , i was shocked . kitchenaid was no help whatsoever . my husband took it apart discovered that the motor still works , but the on/off switch went bad ; however we found that having it repaired would cost as much as a new blender ! ! after years of brand loyalty , i am sad to say that i will not be buying anymore kitchenaid
0	this bread box had to be `` fixed '' by the time i received it . it was a minor thing , and works well , however i would not have bothered buying the box had i known that there would be problems with it
1	the plates are modern and good-looking , always rate compliments from guestts . i would like them more if they were a little bigger
1	having used hoover products in a commercial environment for many years i have had great service from them , providing many years of dependable and powerful operation . we were excited to try out this `` new '' hoover model . one of the first things i have noticed about it over the previous windtunnel model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum . this may bother some , but i see it as a testament to it 's improved build quality over the gen.1 windtunnel . this machine is very powerful and it 's dual turbine motor has a confident sound . i 'll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is . it is a nice feature though . i 'll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is . **update** after having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences ... two very glaring problems with the machine are that it 1 ) lacks a bag full indicator . the bag filled on this machine , and then busted ( unknowlingly ) at the top around the bag collar . `` stuff '' went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter . it took another vacuum to clean the mess up . in the future i will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle , indicating how full the bag is getting . 2 ) the cord rewinder is a nice feature , but truly lacks quality . it will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance . a stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference . 3 ) dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head , not that it presents a problem , but it 's unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust . beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns .
0	this pet chime was a good idea , but i am sending it back . sometimes the chime wo n't ring and at other times it rings on its own and worst of all it starts ringing and wo n't stop . clearly the manufacturer needs to work on quality control
1	i have two kittens which are spoiled rotten and have more toys than they can ever wish for . this is by far one of their favorites . they love the moving ball and use the center scratch area often ( keeps them off the furniture and other areas . ) i know they play with it daily . very reasonably priced and definitely a must for cats ! !
0	the unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface . 100ft . would be pushing it
1	due to the slits around the opening , this label will fit a wide variety of neck sizes including burgundy and those odd rosemount shiraz necks . i would like it better if it were more of a plastic coated paper since i think it would hold up longer in a cellar , but at least it fits all my bottles . the others i 've purchased do n't
1	i ordered these glasses to have extra for a party . fun shape drew compliments . i now shuffled them in to use as my everyday glasses ( all matching ! ) , but i do have concerns with cleaning the larger glass . with no dishwasher , i handwash everything and i find it hard to reach down into the recesses at the base of the tall curved glass . the smaller one is fine -- my hand reaches
1	i bought this as a christmas present for a dear friend of mine who recently began collecting rooster objects . the entire set arrived in perfect condition . the colors , red black are vibrant and striking..the rooster pattern is on each piece and is very nice . very good quality , good size and good price ... will make a perfect holiday gift for serving pasta or stew or salad or whatever
0	i bought this coffeemaker 6 weeks ago and the burner plate is pealing.i also discovered after i had water and coffee grounds all over , that you have to place the carafe with the handle to the side slightly or it will not drip properly.hopefully , i can get my money back , and try another bran
1	everything about our miele ( red velvet ) vacuumn cleaner is top notch , including the bags . the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag . this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner . this is just a small detail , but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company 's products
1	i purchased this for my niece who was pregnant at the time . she started using it right away . she said she feels like the last two trimesters were the easiest and gives credit to feeling healthier since using this juicer . she said it 's very user friendly , and easy to clean up
1	this sheet is great . feels great , looks great , and feels good to the skin . glad i bought it and the price was great
0	the flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did i know that i would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop . when using the wet mop-it will leave water lines where i stop , therefore i have to wipe up the floor with paper towels . when using the vacuum my liquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks ! i have not recommended this product to anyone . a waste of $ 100.00
1	the stool fits under my kitchen table and is easy to move around . i bought this stool for my 3 year old grandson , he pulls it up to the sink when he wants to get a drink of water and he sits on it when he eats his lunch . he loved mine so i bought him one of his own
0	unsatisfied . never received the item.. waited 8 wks before canceling order . purchased item at macy '
1	i ordered the 45-piece place setting , it had to be the quickest turn around i have ever come across . ordered on a thursday , had it on a monday ! everything was in perfect condition . i am so pleased with amazon and the way they do business . i will buy from them again . the dishes are beautiful , i could n't be happier . thank you
0	will not last long only a few months old and getting weak alread
0	the first dishwasher that i received from etronics was dented , dirty and looked as though it had been used . i complained , they picked it up , and one month later i got the replacement . it was n't in much better shape , but i kept it anyway because i was tired of waiting . the dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes , and although it cleans well , the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made , and it leaks even with teflon tape . i would not make this purchase again
0	i bought it . did n't work . exchanged it . the new one did n't work . same problem -- the pump is very weak and just barely seaps out a few drops of liquid soap ... that 's all . and yes , it does very easily rust . spend the extra $ 5 and get something better
1	i bought this vacuum to use in the bathroom which i share with my cat 's kitty litter box . it sits in the corner and after i clean her box i just sweep the spilled litter over to the vac and voom ... all gone
1	i was looking for an offset serrated knife as mentioned by bourdain , and this fits the bill . outstanding veggie slicer and all-around food prep instrument . even over-ripe tomatoes , the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding , are no match for it . besides the small and handy size , the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles . when it finally begins to dull , several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights
0	i returned this -- absolutely unusable . could not keep bottle engaged while pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms
0	after about a month , it started producing cool-mist that smelled funny , like something bad had rotted in the room . the filters are a nuisance . i think i 'm much better off with a steam vaporizer
0	item was defective and this was te second item receive
1	this is wonderful . i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid , but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me . i actually enjoy working with this . the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer , but using really good litter , and not too much of it stops that . i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this
1	we are really good about packing up our meat , vegis and fruit right after purchase . our vacuum sealer has saved us tons of money just from not tossing out stuff that goes bad quickly . the sealer came with rolls to make our own bags , but i found it too cumbersome ; these bags eliminate the difficulty .
1	a very nice blender ... it crushes and purees , just about anything.. i 've had it for three years now and it is still in great condition , and still very powerful ... very loud ! you might need ear protection as you use this . i often turn it on , leave the room , do something else , and come back in when i think it is done ! i 'm not kidding ! :
0	i bought this for my mother a year ago , and i was recently looking for a vacuum myself , so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing , i asked her how she liked it . she said she liked it , and thought it worked well , and loved how light it was ( she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis ) . so ... needless to say i went out and purchased it , trusting mother deartest 's opinion . i hate it ! i just moved out of my house , and i had to clean ( vacuum ) every room in the house . it took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy hoover vacuum to do the job . one sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s*** just to pick up some damn crumbs . also , you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily , after only vacuuming about half a room . it will not suck up hair . rather , it gets tangled in the wheel , and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never , ever cleaned out . hence , making it harder and harder to pick things up ( not that it does to begin with ) . it 's loud , time-consuming , and the biggest waste of money . the only thing it has going for it is its weight , which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway . oh ... and i 've used this product once . once ! one time of use pretty much was all it was worth . if that . i 'm taking it back ... and throwing it at them . do n't waste your money on this people ! !
1	i love this salad spinner . it works easily for two people , spins great , and best of all , it keeps salad incredibly fresh for many days . i highly recommend it
0	these lights are junk , but the vendor i purchased them from is excellen
1	i am really enjoying my sunbeam mixer . it mixes good altho i 'm not to crazy about the button to raise the mixer it is a little hard to push . i would buy another one if i had to .
0	i might have bought these pans if i could find out how deep they are
0	i loved this vacuum initially . you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however , the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately , to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint . you ahve to empty the filter every 5-10 minutes . i do not have a terribly messy household , just one with no stairs going to the front backyard
1	i love this - it keeps the bed toasty . i takes some time to warm up the bed . i turn it to 5 and leave it there for an hour . when i get it , it 's very nice and i turn it down to 1 or 2 . i find if i keep it on 5 all night i roast . i do prefer this product to an electric blanket . it has n't made a noticable impact on my electricity bills , and it was worth the purchase price . if you have a big pillowtop mattress , the pad does n't quite fit like a generously sized fitted sheet . otherwise , i would have given the product 5 stars
0	if i could give half a star i would . i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day . i used it less than 3 times a week . there are several drawbacks to this unit . it draws alot of electricity to run it . i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on . water gurgles/spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned . the spout is also poorly designed , the water does n't come out in an even stream , it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid . the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean . the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it . i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago . it is everything this kettle is n't and so much more . read the reviews on that one before you buy this one . its a better choice all around . save the shipping costs , time headache , just buy the braun first and pass this one up .
1	we were very skeptical . one of our cats would mark certain spots ( like corners ) occassionaly . but we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room ! it got so bad that we had to discard the rug . we tried boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day , but the one time we forgot to spray , he would mark again . we were at our wits end and decided to try feliway . we bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots . at first we also used the boundary , but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we did n't see any urine markings anymore . it took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work . our cat even appears more calm and pleasant . we make sure that we replace the container of feliway every 5 weeks or so . it 's well worth the money
0	i only used the cup 4 times before my trying to get the lid back on ( not exactly easy because of push on design versus screw on ) , caused the inner lid seal to break . the lid is now worthless and needs to be replaced . now i have to deal with seeing if amazon will help me replace the unit , even though i already sent the packaging to the recycler a week or so ago . i would not recommend anyone purchasing this unit , due to the lid issue and other points made in the other comments herein
1	my grandma 's 10 year old yorkie just would never shut up . he barked at our cat , at our parrot , and anything that moved really . we bought this collar , and it worked perfectly and immediately . one bark and it sprayed , and he would go running off ... and stop barking ! i felt kinda bad for him , but his reaction was hilarious . i could n't stop laughing at him , poor thing . however , he did learn that if the collar was n't on , he was n't going to get sprayed , so he would bark
0	if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment , this is n't for you . the radio is hard to use since it does n't have any indication of what frequency you are on , and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static . the pedometer function is marginal at best . but its what you would expect for $ 15 .
1	it 's not the most amazing space saving contraption in the world , but it works . definitely helps reduce clutter
1	great all around microwave for singles . the only thing it does not do well is microwave popcorn
0	order the wok and got it damaged ( off-shaped ) . the packaging is horrible . basiclly they put the bare wok in the box filled with the giant air bubbles . the wok can move around freely in the box . guess the damage is caused during shipping . return and reordered the typhoon carbon steel wok , similar size and design , $ 3 cheaper . when i got it , i am very pleased with the quality : * ) properly packaged , plastic cover on the top , sheet of paper on the bottom ; fitted in a box designed for it ; * ) thick steel : 2.5mm rather than 1.8mm from joyce chen ; * ) handles are welded on the wok , so no dead spot when cleaning ; * ) seasoning instruction are well documented , in 8 different languages , even thou i use my own seasoning way , not like joyce chen 's one thin sheet of paper with not so clear instruction . overall , joyce chen 's wok is like the one you can get from chinatown supermarket , and typhoon one is like from macy 's
1	my husband received a similar bag for christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer . we are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine . the black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we do n't have to worry about the bottom falling out . the material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well
1	i really like having this . it 's odor free and easy to use . yes , you have to empty the bags and that takes time , but it 's worth it . i have found refills at walmart , petsmart and petco . so they have n't been hard to find
1	i have two of these in my home and they really help to cut down on smells and dander from our two cats . and the filters are inexpensive enough to be able to change regularly
1	most importantly , this is small . this is the same size as one-person clay pot rice or bibimbap . it is the size of a deep rich fancy curry takeout . one cup of steel cut oatmeals will fill up the pot upon expansion . i have no regrets ordering this size because this is much easier to tote around . now that i have received my shipment , i know a yellow one with a brass knob would have been gorgeous but i have grown to prefer the red . it 's so pretty . it did n't arrive chipped or anything so there 's not much to say about how it works . just keep the heat between medium to low . i broke it in by making hot milk ( from powder ) with banana so yeah , as a pot , it heats stuff up . no leaks . p.s . one good thing about breaking in the cocotte with white liquid instead of clear water is that i saw two floating black segments that may have been pieces of the coating - yes i did wash the cocotte in sudsy water before breaking it in . i still do n't know where those chips off of the 5 quart are now but i hope they are at least not or no longer in our bodies . i think this try me size is a worthwhile purchase because it is light enough to lift up and tilt with one hand to pour into a serving bowl
1	i was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting . i found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try . it does a perfect job ! i owned the original model when it first came out years ago . this one is more streamlined and improved . the dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups .
0	if you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed ... do n't ! i have two areobeds ; i bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out . the pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it . fifteen years later it still works like a charm . i liked it so much ; i recently bought a minute bed because i needed another guest bed . it does not say anywhere on the box that you can not use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours . needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa . the battery is nicad , which means it develops a memory , so now even if i remembered to charge it the day before , it does not run long enough to inflate the bed . they do not offer a separate electric , detachable pump , so now i 'm stuck with a `` plastic carpet '' that can not be inflated with anything else . the areobeds work great , but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion , buy a different type .
0	i heard about the lids and hoped that they would be a good alternative to plastic wrap . i even bought two for gfts . but they did n't live up to my expectations . the large size did n't even fit on standard size bowls and the small one did n't fit on small bowls . i would return them except that i threw out the original packaging . i do n't recommend this product
1	what a great masterpiece ! this beautiful salt and pepper shaker set is an attractive , useful set . great to use for bright rooms ! cheery color- even the pepper will brighten your day
1	i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum . wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction . it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum . so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities . its so light ... about nine pounds and easy to transport and store . its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button . the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum . they are very easy to get at and change . its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors , along baseboards and on stairways . not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch . i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming . this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright . my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool . many third-party vacuum attachments would work with it too . i am glad i bought it and would recommend it . its the vacuum i would use most . the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done . push a button and the cord automatically rewinds . whats not to like about this vacuum . highly recommended
0	people cliam this fan is quiet , it 's not quiet . i wanted a fan that will circulate the bedroom air during the night , it 's too loud and keeps me awake
1	i feel rich sleeping in these sheets ! they are quite wrinkley , but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible . i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i 'm sure . money well spent
1	it 's a towel . not too much to say , for more information , read the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams . very good quality , resiliant , color has n't faded , despite being used to dry me off after falling into a creek , being used as padding for my elbow at the firing range , and wiping up spilled cleaning chemicals . tough little bugger
1	this is absolutely , hands down , the best toy we 've gotten for our dogs . we own three sets of these in varying sizes . because the balls are plush , they will wear out- this is not for your destructive chewers . our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day . before leaving for work , pop a couple of treats inside and you 're out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks .
0	you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food . it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat . only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they 're doing . do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok
1	we love these glasses , we have had the reidel glasses , like these , many times . . . they break so easily and ca n't go in the dishwasher . these glasses are so much more utilitarian , we use them as our everyday glasses , not just for wine . they look great , feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher , and cost so much less . we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions , they are more refined , but i got so tired of that ultra-thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass . i strongly recommend the libbey glasses . . . you will like it , like , like it on your table , table , table
1	aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the '4 ' setting , it 's pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it 's warmed up ( keep it closed ) . i modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what i do . sure , they occasionally stick and i do n't always get the batter in right , and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it 's on , but this is n't a $ 100 device , it 's just a nice little waffle maker
1	the bumble bee is a known sign for qaulity in france . these type of knives are the same ones used in the top restaurants in france and the rest of the world over . there is not a finer steak knife in the world . i have been to the factory and have seen these craftsmen at work . they create perfection
0	the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan . it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan . the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive . i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off . now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan . think twice before you purchase this pan
1	having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan , as the tittle says : pay the 3-4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead . i 'm using the preseasoned more because it is just ready . keep in mind its large and heavy . careful in your sink . coming from stainless steel and converted over to calphalon ( mostly bought all pieces from amazon.com ) , if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me . heat kills everything . if you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water / salt / scrubbing.. and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark , then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with . but we all pay for convience and these pans i use mostly to sear meat . with a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives , get the preseasoned .
0	my pump just up and quit after several years ... and it did n't always work great , but when it did , it was ideal . so i 'll replace it , but with some other product , not the cuisipro again .
0	the skinny grill satin black came in chestnut brown and brokken to pieces . still waiting for some relief in terms of a credit . i feel like the guilty party , even though all i did was give them my hard earned money and trust that they would deliver a product to me . so far ... computer form replys !
0	unless you 're planning on washing dinner plates only , this dish rack is not for you . smaller plates ( or bowls for that matter ) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips ( about 1/8 inch ) so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open ( 3 1/4 inches ) . anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor . the utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom . i bought this thinking that since polder has a good name , it would be a good product . i was wrong and polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design
1	this is just what i was looking for . i use it for the few dishes that do n't make it in to the dishwasher , but mostly for drying the baby bottles . the bottle drying systems are pretty ugly and can only be used for that purpose . this drying rack is very useful for the bottles and dishes
0	this is junk . the blades tore through the plastic with the first potato i tried to slice . the apple slicer broke on the 4th apple . the blades are not sharp , and takes considerable force to get it to slice anything . the julianne attachment would not slice a block of chedder , though i do think any attachment would be able to slice brie , and if not that , then perhaps jello . worst purchase i ever made with the name kitchenaid on it
1	clean , elegant , easy to use and clean , but this cutting board has an aesthetic appeal that goes beyond mere functionality . clean lines , thinner than most boards , and the look and feel of wood without the practical ( and bacterial ) problems . a joy to use
1	i have no kitchen stove so i have been relying on this little champ for everything from tea to pasta ( before south beach diet ) to making eggs in the morning , etc . i have owned this unit for over 3 years and have never once had a problem with it . awesome for a college student or a person with a tiny apartment such as mine . also great for taking to work . it is a bit hard to clean and there is not too much area to touch to move it while it is still cooling down . other than that , i highly recommend it . i am here today to buy the double version and i can only hope that it performs as well as it 's little sister . enjoy ! ! ! - li
0	still ca n't figure out what this scissor cuts ... ... ... ... ..it surely is not poultry , or meat or fish ... ... ... ... ... .i will have to try it on paper but then i did n't need another paper scissor ! ! ! ! !
1	i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware . mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice -- sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse ! i was surprised at how small it was , but it did say 6 '' and 6 '' it is . you wo n't bake a pie in it ( unless you make individual ones ) but it will be great for dips and sauces
1	this is one of the prettiest shades fiestaware has put out . i would like to see them put out a bright shade of pink as well
0	bad quality , on/off switch and plastic ring broken after 1 year .
1	this knife is great for hard cheeses , i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces . it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife . the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily , but if you only use it for cheese , it should stay sharp for a long time . this is another beautiful global knife
0	i have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more , francis francis being my first . this machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as `` espresso '' machines but marginally . if you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important . focusing on the machine for a moment . you need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee . a truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste . this machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans . the espresso extracted is thus poor in taste . if you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra . you will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results . the cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the cutting of the beans are fixed
0	i purchased this toy for a friend 's dog a while back . the dog loved it , he played with it non-stop ( quack ! quack ! ) . when he finally destroyed it though we were shocked . inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag . my friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items . we did complain to the manufacturer who said they 'd look into it , but i would still be wary of this toy . i think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it 's toys , but does n't rip them to shreds ! there is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe !
1	i received great customer service and a beautiful plant here . i would recommend this gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift . my gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition , is still very healthy , and smells terrific . i 've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said `` what smells so good grandma ?
1	my husband and i took over a house with 2 kitchens , and i wanted to decorate the smaller one in cream an black . i fell in love with these , but never received them ... they were sent to the wrong address and after the 2nd time , amazon would n't send them again and i gave up . i went ahead and gave them 5 stars 'cause i was at a freinds house and she had these dishes . they were really heavy and the print was consistent . i 'm so jealous
0	i had this blender for 3-4 years and was very unhappy with it . the design is poor ( liquids tend to dribble terribly when poured ) , the motor seems weak , and it is hard to clean . food seems to get under the metal band around the top and is not reachable . today , after only sporadic , medium-duty use over the few years i had it , my blender outright died . i have other cuisinart products that perform very well , but this blender is a loser
0	this red-and-white cutting board looks attractive and helps brighten up the kitchen counter . however , it arrived warped , so that i really can only use one side ( the board slides around on the counter when i flip it over )
0	ok ... this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted . it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris , and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds , not minutes . also , it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil . really , its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge . stupid ... .stupid ... stupid design . the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together ... its like a rubics cube . a true waste of 40 bucks . do n't buy this ! it does n't even look very cool
1	i 've owned a littermaid mega for about 5 years and i really wish i had been able to buy this stand sooner . we have two cats and we 're terribly lazy . we 've had this stand for a few months and it works as described . it has drastically reduced the smell and the need to clean the box . we love this stand and it has made life a lot more bearable when it comes to the litter box . our old littermaid just died on us and we went to replace it with a new littermaid elite but the stand is n't large enough . the newer elite model is much longer than this stand and it will hang off the back and over the sides . we love that stand more than we want the newer littermaid elite and we are getting a great deal on the old style of the littermaid mega from amazon . i would just be aware , before buying this , that it only fits the old style of littermaids . that being said , if you 're handy with power tools and woodwork than you might be able to modify it ... it is a simple design .
0	2 years ago i purchased these dishes , i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star ... .until 6 months ago . all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half ( these dishes are microwave safe , and no children ) all have broken in the same place ... 2 broke when picking up , 4 have broken while microwaving yet all my cups , bowls , salad , square plates are still in perfect condition.. but without my dinner plates , my set ( s ) are useless ! !
1	best investment i have ever made in cookware . heats evenly , more thoroughly and burns less . amazingly tough and the best part is i do n't have to hunt for special `` plastic '' utensils to mix and stir . this is sweet cookware and so dang easy to clean , i love it !
0	it was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though i always kept it charged . since this is the type of product you might take camping i do n't recommend it because it 's not reliable . i used it once or sometimes twice a day ... .no more so i really think it should have lasted longer
0	saw these canisters and fell in love with them . could n't wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces . they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal does n't fit properly . another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off . i was disppointed in the quality . i would n't buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive
1	we have 2 airedale terriers ( 55-lb dogs ) and 2 cats . i originally bought a scat-mat as a deterrent to the cats , but it has since become a dog deterrent . one of our dogs has a tendency to knock over the gate to the kitchen and get into the trash while we 're not at home . this is the only deterrent that has proven effective . it keeps her from being able to work on the gate long enough to get it down ( as she 'll keep getting shocked if she stands there ) . i feel comfortable using the product , as i have been shocked by it many times myself ( generally i step on it by accident in the middle of the night ) . make no mistake , it hurts , and you do n't want to have it happen , but it certainly is n't bad enough that i feel cruel using it . this is my second scat mat , as the other one stopped working . because of that , i 'm a bit concerned about the durability , especially considering the cost . that said , however , the design of this model is a vast improvement over the last ( no wires going to the battery that may become detached ) , so i am hopeful that this one will last longer . either way , however , it has saved me enough hassle to be well worth the money .
1	there is n't much you can say about a sharpening steel . it sharpens well , and is extremely fine for keeping already sharp blades at their sharpest . the handle is ugly gray plastic , but it seems solidly put together , and is easy to work with
1	my mom has arthritis in her hands pretty bad . most peelers are difficult to impossible for her to use . not this one , it works flawlessly . it is easy to hold in her hand , and the blade is sharp enough to do a great job on potatos and carrots
0	i love the cookware set . 12 pans to do 12 different meals . they are very durable and holds up well to the heat
1	as previously mentioned , while they call this red , it is really a burnt-orange . if you are trying to match some other red beware ! the potholders themselves are very functional and if color is n't an issue , then buy these !
1	i had to replace my space saver b on a sunday morning . i wanted another thermal carafe model but was n't realy ready to shell out $ 80 for the braun even witht the good reviews . i found this on clearance at target for $ 35 and i bought a cuisinart gold filter for it . i did not like the fact the mr coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter . anways , there is not much i can say bad about this machine . things i like : looks , brew seletor , self clean feature , makes good coffee , the carafe is one the best i have used . the easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well , inexpensive and work pretty well . i dont have any of the leak problems . things i would change : could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker , the unit beeps 5 times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but i tend to set it to go on before the family is up . overall for what i paid for this i 'm very pleased
1	the stool is excellent quality - looks good and works well . the surprise is the weight - very heavy
1	i have a 3 1/2 year old boxer that barks , cries , whines , and howls when i go to work ... all day ... i know , i recorded it . i went to petsmart and picked up this gadget . brought it home and it the manual correct button . she bolted . she hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes . it reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and i do n't crate my dog when i 'm going to be away for more than 8 hours . so if i 'm just running out for a few hours i stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if i 'm going to work i use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar . my girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he 's otherwise engaged but my dog hates it . worth the price in my opinion . best advice is to take it home and try it . some dogs react to it . others do n't
0	i , too , received this item with chipped corners , scratches , and broken pieces . unfortunately , the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it , so we 'll have to live with the damage . it 's a nice-looking desk otherwise , but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time
1	these are great and match the duvet cover wonderfully . i am very pleased with my purchase !
1	i like these knives . very sharp and a value for the money . long term who knows ... i 've had mine a little over a year and completely satisfied
0	although i have used this model before and have all good results , the one i bought for christmas did not work . jura capresso states that they test their machines before they leave the factory . they might have tested mine and it may have worked , but all it did for me was spit out hot water underneath the tray . i tried different grind settings but to no avail , water flowing out the bottom of the machine . too bad as this was a gift for all of my family . imagine the look on their faces when all they got was water dripping onto the floor
0	i got these sheets and was very pleased with them at first . after a couple of days i observed color sticking to everything around . the worst , it painted my matress in red color ! ! i tried my best to remove the color but it wont go away . now i found the best place for these sheets - in the attic
0	i bought this aquarium for my son for his birthday last summer and thought it was great ... that is until it started leaking about 4 months after i bought it . giving the benefit of the doubt , and thinking the leak was a qa issue rather than a design issue , i managed to exchange it for the exact same model . well it 's been 4 months since i got the new one , and this morning what did i notice ? yup , a leak . the tank was full yesterday and this morning it 's 2/3 's full , with a pool of water on the table that holds it . luckily , no damage was done to the floor either time . i understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then , but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time , well then , it 's just a cruddy product . stay away from this aquarium
1	the good ( function ) : 1 ) rubber non-slip base and good weighting 2 ) clear plastic , allows full view of soap level 3 ) long spout allows easy access to sink . no counter spills ! 4 ) smooth pumping action - no clogs 5 ) pump goes all the way to the bottom - `` sucks '' it all out ! 6 ) wide opening makes it easy to transfer soap from a large bottle . the bad ( aesthetics ) : 1 ) not beautiful ( not horribly ugly either ) 2 ) no choice of color . would have preferred white to match kitchen appliances . verdict : function wins out over aesthetics . highly recommended
0	i received my granos as a birthday present two years ago . as had already been reported here , the machine is great -- when it works . i thought i was the only one who had leak problems but most everyone who wrote a review here reported the same problem . leak from the bottom and leak from the water container . i called customer service to report the problem and they sounded like they 've never heard of the problem . they asked me to return the machine but i did n't bother . a good customer service should have already heard the problem before customers call . a $ 600 espresso machine should last more than two years . i ca n't believe a company like bodum is not concerned about its product . i 'm buying another espresso machine and it 's not going to be bodum again
1	i have been using a chemex 10-cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life . i am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee ! there is a downside to this coffee maker : it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to , and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently . the first time i tried to use mine , i had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever ! the big time consumers : you have to boil your water separately ( you do have a water kettle right ? ) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the chemex . this means that while the coffee is brewing , you are pouring , or watching , or giving the filter area a bit of a stir . now the up side : you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee . i use filtered water , freshly ground home roasted beans , and this chemex to produce the finest coffee i have ever had the pleasure of drinking . and this coffee is a pleasure ! in fact , i 've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide . another up side : clean up means swishing the chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain . you can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary . a brief swish is really all it takes to get your chemex looking factory new . try that with your electric drip machine ! ha ! that thing will never look brand new ! oh , here 's a final upside : this chemex brews the best coffee you 'll ever drink , and it costs less than just about anything . you are probably already spending more money than this every month at starbucks ! go ahead and buy yourself one of these . if necessary , wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee . better yet , wake up 20 minutes earlier . and when your coffee is ready , instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door , sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes . you deserve it ! update : it 's been a year now and i still love this chemex . however , over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge that gradually became darker with each use . nothing i tried got it clean , but something my wife tried did : a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water followed by a thorough swishing . now my chemex looks brand new
0	this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image ... it broke the second week i had it ... spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor . it 's pure crap . stay away ! !
1	holds everything . makes perfect pot roasts . i use all clad mc2 for most cooking , but when i need to braise i use this -- i love it
1	wow , this salter kitchen scales is highly accurate . i always get a perfect bake everytime . i definitely recommend this product . you 'll never be disapointed with its quality .
0	this `` tea cattle '' is absolutely adorable . it is not practical for daily use . the spout does n't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove . the lid does n't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move .
0	too expensive , too little heat , unit quit after a year of intermittent use - i wo n't buy vornado again .
1	i was pleased with these canisters . the lids do not screw on but seem to be airtight with the rubber seal . the only complaint i have is that they appeared to be shiny in the photo , but are actually brushed stainless
1	i was surprised by the quick delivery . i opened the box to check the bowls . everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present
1	these mikasa spoons go perfectly with your demitasse or espresso cups . very delicate with nice finish . we enjoy them every time we use them
0	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out . it was wonderful . wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one , i bought this item . i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it . i was suspect when i opened it . poor quality material . poor bed fit . very very warm on the lowest setting . after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires , which are quite large , in my ribs -- it had to come off . i had rather be cold and i hate being cold
1	i would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone ! it is stylish , sleek , easy to clean , and has plenty of power to handle anything . i feel sorry for michigan , mix 3 apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink ! awesome ! awesome the first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol ' prune who would n't be happy with anything ! get it now !
0	i received this popper as a gift , and while it looks nice , it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine . i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn . nothing worked . if i had the receipt it would already have been returned . since i do n't , it is going in the garbage . also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine . stay away from this machine
0	packaged with four left legs ( requires two left , two right ) one briquette grate is smaller than the other and falls to bottom as a result . had to drill / elongate hole to install grate support bracket paint on handles started to run when i handled them with wet hands . i tried to rinse off the remaining paint or ink under running water so that it will not continue to bleed off . what paint do you know of that rinses off under plain water ? right cast iron grate cracked when it came in contact with heat . the design and construction of this product shows clear disregard for the consumer and is absolutely unacceptable at any price . i have to question at this point weather or not the paint used on the grill and grates is toxic or lead based . i 've come across my share of junk but this is really bad !
1	i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party . it was the talk of the whole school . the kids loved it . i used sephra chocolate ( a coupon was included ) , so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil . the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression . the cascading , flowing , chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box , but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil , but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine . i also saved $ 25.00 by buying the chp ( champaigne color ) version
0	drip , drip , drip . one drip at a time . it takes 20 minutes to fill a pasta pot . we 've had it 3 years ( it never worked any faster than this ) and sometimes i 'm just tempted to just use the tap water and not worry about lead poisoning from the pipes
1	my husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me . i thought okay until i opened the package . this shamrock green is so pretty . this dinnerware is great . a nice heavyweight . the glazing is brillant . and the cereal bowls are a good size . not too small as other types tend to be . i am very happy i own this and have bought more since
0	i bought this product in december 2004 . after two months of use ( about once a week ) the on/off switch broke . eventually after using it for a year ( and trying to get hoover to correct the problem ) , just before christmas 2005 i got quite a fright when i started smelling smoke whilst using it . i discontinued the use of the product , and asked hoover once again to please look at it . their reply was that i should take it to one of their authorised shops , where they 'll repair it , charge me . then hoover will see if it was in fact a factory error and only then refund me when they feel they 're not in the wrong . please . do n't waste your money on this product . it is defnitely not worth it . it is noisy , vacuums carpets well when used to work , but is unable to vacuum floors at all . ( one of the options on it ) . sorry , hoover . but you have lost a loyal customer . ( my whole family for 3 generations back has always bought hoover , including myself ...
0	i ca n't figure out what is so special about this rice cooker so i am irritated by the price which is making me wonder if their whole product line is over priced
0	i bought this item based on price , how can you go wrong for 10 $ for a programable coffee maker ? well , you get what you pay for . after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks , it just stopped working ! just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item ! based on the rest of the reviews , i just threw away and went out and bought a mr. coffee . lesson learned . treehous
0	as others have stated the gears are plastic and will fail after 1 to 2 years , and no replacement parts to fix , so the can opener has to trashed
1	i love this filter ! it keeps the water pristine and more importantly it is easy to assemble and clean thanks to the included double tap valves and media basket . silence was a key buying point for me as it was purchased for an aquarium in my bedroom . this filter is absolutely silent . so silent that i can now hear the hum of my fluorescent aquarium lights
0	the packaging had n't been so pathetic . the tiny pieces of styrofoam , that failed to cushion the fridge during shipping , led to a fridge that arrived leaking coolant . the cooling part of the unit had come dislodged from the frame , and one of the pipes was broken and leaking . plus there was no crisper drawer included . i wo n't be buying a replacement from sanyo ! !
0	clock is smaller than i thought , and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall . made of cheap materials , definitely not worth $ 25
1	you ca n't go wrong with this knife . i use it almost as much as i use my 8 inch chef 's knife . it holds an edge well , feels light in your hand , and has perfect ballance .
1	if you are terrible at making rice as i am , this is a very helpful product . the liquid tends to boil over if cooked at high temp in my microwave . i cook the rice at 50 % power for about 50 % longer than the directions recommend and it comes out perfectly . easy clean up in the dishwasher . it is a bit of a pain to store , but i 'd buy it again . also comes with a steamer insert for cooking vegetables , etc . but i have n't tried that yet
0	i think this may be a great product , and is why i bought it . however , mine never worked ( and hence was never actually used , it was just taken out of the box ! ) the remote would beep the collar but not spray . seller did have manufacturer send new batteries ( which further delayed my getting a good response to this situation ) . new batteries arrived , item still did n't spray , but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer , to get a replacement , even though i responded within their advertised 30 day return policy . please read seller information and return policies carefully ! even if you get them to take something back ( only if never opened ... if opened and does n't work , they toss you to the manufacturer ) , there is a 25 % restocking fee ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! pretty exorbitant and not amazon type service i have come to expect over many years of buying from amazon ! be very careful of sellers that are not amazon ... sometimes it is n't very clear it is not amazon . my feedback on seller is on feedback page and seller responded , but i do n't get a chance to respond to their feedback , which gives the misconception that i actually used this product ! i could n't have used it as it did n't work ! if you want to buy this , i 'd recommend a reputable pet store such as pet smart where you can easily take an item back if it does n't work and get a refund . even if they are willing to replace something , you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two and would want a refund , which most stores have no problem with doing for you . next time i go the established pet stores
0	the towel is quite soft , however after using it , your body will be covered with small fibers all over . - not recommended
1	i owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once . but this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly , at first . but after only about 6 weeks of use , the flip-up spout broke off - actually just broke in half . i replaced it with a chantal teakettle and so far so good
0	i was impressed with all the pieces , liked the pots with short handles . but , when washing the lids , the handles on top get full of water and have to be sat up for water to drain out ... s l o w l e y , before putting them away . also the metal on the handles has a tendency to get very warm when you 're cooking . but , what do you want for 30 bucks ?
1	the fact that you do n't have to rotate the trays like some other dehydrators is great ! we have made a lot of beef jerky since buying the snackmaster express . it is a great product , works great
0	i could not believe it was for only one cup . i did not read throughly and thought it was for four . big dissapointment
0	i bought this griddle under the impression that it was non-stick - it is everything but that . i only cook with butter ( no sprays ) , but that does not matter . even with butter the eggs stick every time . even pancakes stick . this is the worst grill i have ever used
0	total rubbish . wood was scratched on top , corner was smashed , water damage on the shelf , and door was cracked . it is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use . the holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together . extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control . to add salt in the wound , the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and i had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it . if you like taking chances and do still want to buy it , it 's probably a 50-50 chance that it will be damaged .
0	i bought this item about 6 months ago . after 2 months the handle fell off . on phoning the company , they said plastic parts were only guaranteed for 1 month , hence they would not replace it . after another 2 months , the unit stopped working altogether . i then got in touch with the company and managed to speak to a very rude customer service representative , who said i would have to send it to the company and pay for shipping and handling myself , yet it says in the handbook that the company would pay for the shipping . i am truely disappointed with the lack of customer care and the appliance . i do believe i have a faulty appliance but the compnay is not at all bothered to keep its customers happy . i do not reccomend that anyone buy this item , save your money and all the hastle
0	i bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6-10 times over the course of 13 months , it stopped working . i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it ca n't be repaired i should just throw it away ! i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless ! buy one at you own risk
1	it 's still brand new , so everything 's working great . i really love the color ; i bought it to match my yellow standmixer .
