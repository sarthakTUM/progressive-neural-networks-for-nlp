1	in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town ,  partied pretty hardy .  after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the usa .    the drovers who worked for trail boss gil favor as played by eric fleming were no different .  but fleming was a man of all business ,  he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it .    with the long run of rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part ,  we got to know all the drovers at some point .  a some point story lines were focused around all of them ,  though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood's character rowdy yates ,  the number 2 guy with the herd .   clint eastwood's western image was molded by rawhide ,  it's a shame that these are not shown more often .  probably because they were done in black and white .  had this been an nbc show ,  this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are .  we'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend .   ironically enough it was eric fleming who left the show before it closed to do films .  he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name .  sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film ,  drowned in a river .  had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood's .   clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run .  and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre .   rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it .  no frills in this one ,  these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year .   they really don't make television series like these any more .  what a pity .
0	mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957 .   well ,  the movie mainly takes place in 1986 .  the movie falls into the 80's trap of weird/stupid special effects ,  including some weird demented looking rocking horse .   anyway ,  mary lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body .  whether or not she succeeds ,  you'll have to watch to find out .   anyway ,  the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters .  this also isn't really a sequel ,  the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school .  it has the avg .  horror flick fall backs ,  gore ,  pointless nudity ,  knocks against the catholic church .  basic stuff ,  boring movie .   the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 .  you can waste your time doing something else .
0	well ,  it's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said .  but the thing is ,  i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i've seen .  so ,  i have to write something .   the acting is stupid .  it's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash .  the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child .  the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be .  don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary .  we don't see how the granpa is killed .  the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die ,  you just don't sympathize with them .  and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better .  we just hear him scream and we see nothing !
0	this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of  " they saved hitler's brain "  the worst movie i have ever seen period .  when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with .    the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness ,  some flatulence jokes ,  some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy .  the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let's make a deal with stupid grossness .  the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor .  the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street .  the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness .  the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering  " there is no difference "  with a french accent was ,  well you get my point .   the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute .  this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie .  oh yea i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high .  well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's .  if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine .  there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie .  of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was .
1	for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them .  fatty drives the bus is the exception .  it is the truth .  it is the best  " bad "  movie ever .   the  " badness "  of this movie seems to come naturally .  halfway through satan's opening monologue ,  the word  " hell "  appears at the bottom of the screen .  the glamorous bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress .  it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs .  jesus walks to a funk soundtrack .   anyways ,  fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior's film project .  but it's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful .  you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad ,  but never forced it .   never to be duplicated in wonder ,  fatty delivers .  highly highly recommended .
0	i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies ,  but this one is a real stinker !  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it .  the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching .  he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together .   angie harmon ,  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president ,  truly butchered the role .  there was no chemistry with gooding ,  her demeanor was flat and wooden ,  and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd .  this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  " b "  list .   and what was cuba gooding thinking ?  ?  ?  he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances ,  but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him .   poor james woods and burt reynolds .  poor poor poor poor poor .
0	wow .  .  .  what would you do with $33m ?  let me give you a choice ;  you can either a )  shred it and flush it down the toilet or b ) make a film based on the premise of whoopi goldberg as a hard nut futuristic cop partnered with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like  " i didn't butt trumpet "  and blows raspberries on the basis that this is funny .  that's right ,  you would choose the option that has more merit - flushing down the toilet .   this has to be seen to be believed .  i cannot even find the words to describe how bad this film is .  it doesn't even fit into the  " so bad - it's good "  category .  i actually have it on the television as i write - and whilst watching i felt the need to come onto imdb and register my disgust .   considering jurassic park was made a couple of years before ,  how on earth did they think that audiences would any longer tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit ?  wg should have simply walked and damn the consequences .  everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money .   i have to stop writing - i am about to implode .
1	   " bleak house "  is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen .  alway one of my favorite novels , i was exteremely pleased with this television mini series .  the late ,  great denholm elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john jardyce and diana rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed ladty dedlock .  the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book , oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story .  over all a brilliant , moving and atmosphereic film .
0	before i begin ,  you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny chiba's films .  his biographical series of the life of his master ,  mas oyama ,  were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made ,  as were most of his street fighter films .  the action was practically non-stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee  ( depending on who you ask )  ,  he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s .  because they are so good ,  i've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more  ( which i am in the process of watching )  .   unfortunately ,  despite my love of these films ,  i am not a mind-numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that i rate every film a 10 .  there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn't even close to the being chiba's best work .  a score of 10 isn't a real rating--it's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba ,  not this film !  as i said ,  technically this film is awful .  some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version ,  with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing .  but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print .  the camera-work is simply atrocious--like it was done by chimps  ( smart chimps ,  but still chimps nonetheless )  .  often ,  much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production .  and ,  again and again ,  the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched--with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly .   i don't know whether the musical score is original or not--but it was also very ,  very bad .  sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with ennio morricone's  " spaghetti western "  music--it was annoying ,  distracting and just plain silly .   as for the martial arts action ,  i think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit .  instead of the great fight scenes you'd look forward to in a chiba film ,  the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera !  !  so what you are left with is the story .  .  . and this might just be the worst part of the film !  it's supposed to be an anti-drug film starring sonny chiba as .  .  .  . sonny chiba !  and when the film begins ,  he vows to destroy the drug trade in japan .  but ,  the mafia  ( complete with not a single member who looks italian ,  but who are all japanese )  vows to stop chiba .  and ,  when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade ,  he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions--even though she's never forthright about telling him what she knows !  in fact ,  later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine--and he continues trying to protect her !  !  this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script--such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk .   so if it was that bad ,  why still does it merit a 3 ?  well ,  first ,  there are many more horrid marital arts films  ( such as many of those from hong kong in the 1970s ) --including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting  ( now that's bad )  .  second ,  while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films ,  compared to its contemporaries ,  it's not that bad .  still ,  you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film .   by the way ,  if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film ,  it certainly is not !  in one of his first films ,  invasion of the neptune men ,  chiba plays a leotard-wearing super-hero who battles pointy-headed invaders from the planet neptune .  it's so bad that it rivals plan 9 from outer space and they saved hitler's brain for awfulness .   a final note to parents--like most of sonny chiba's films ,  this one is very violent and has its share of boobies .  don't let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg !  make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated-r martial arts films !
0	the fiendish plot of dr .  fu manchu starring peter sellers in a spoof of the characters created by sax rohmer is an injustice to the end of sellers' career .  the plot was very simplistic ,  and if done the right way could have been handled nicely ,  but instead it was poorly executed .  part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog ,  cheap laughs ,  choppy directing ,  and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete .   the acting ,  on the other hand ,  was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture .  i found sellers portrayal of diabolical manchu brilliantly done ,  with the occasional lines that will be remembered .  for example ,  there is the scene where fu manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says  " ah ,  you all look the same to me .  "  i hate to admit it ,  but i laughed out loud with that line .   then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of helen mirren as the backstabbing constable ,  david tomilson as sir roger avery  ( his last film as well ,  not a way to end a career )  ,  and sid ceasar  ( who gives a rather whimsical performance of al capone's relative who works for the fbi )  .  these characters also kept me watching .   the sets were also nice .  oriental designs and english society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture .   in all honesty ,  my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a peter sellers or sid ceasar fan .  otherwise ,  you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil .
1	i remember following the case of andre chicatillo in the newspapers while i was living in south africa .  they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court .  not ,  as it turned out ,  to protect the court members ,  but to protect him from the public .  this was fascinating ,  albeit morbid ,  reading .  i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case ,  but it was made for american tv .  bummed !  strangely ,  citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa .  i charged down to the local ster kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket  ( i was alone ;  my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel magnolias and fried green tomatoes )  .  wow !  what a brilliant film .  why wasn't it released to a wider audience ?  had it not been made for tv ,  it could have got an oscar nomination or 2 .  there is no way to spoil the ending ;  who the killer is is never kept from the audience .  jeffrey demunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho .  he is calm ,  downtrodden ,  considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work .  by committing these horrendous acts ,  he gets to feel strong ,  powerful .   fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist ,  played to excellent turn by stephen rea ,  in one of his strongest performances .  he must battle the snail-pace of russian bureaucracy ,  the primitive resources he has at his disposal and  ( above all )  the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the ussr even has a serial killer .  the general in charge  ( joss ackland )  says that serial killers are  " a decadent ,  western phenomenon "  .  only donald sutherland is willing to help ,  but his help must be under the counter .  the ever-brilliant max von sydow plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest .  it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose ,  and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public .   citizen x is brilliantly acted ,  well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film .  excellent support from a horribly underused imelda staunton and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing .  this was too good to be made for tv
0	*warning - no plot spoilers ahead ,  but movie spoilers nonetheless .  .  . * my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast .  wow - very ,  very wrong .  this movie is an overdone ,  overwrought ,  and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot !  the copyright date on the box said 2005 ,  yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s ,  and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos .  it looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film !  i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback ,  and therefore supposed to look old ,  but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s .  .  .  then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up ,  and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences  ( yet it's a different ,  much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks )  .  i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences ,  shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie !  it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up  ( and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes )  .  thus ,  this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old ,  re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time .  the shell story ,  shot in 2005 ,  is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead  ( something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the  " fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 ?  )  these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful ,  overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie .  don't bother .  there's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible .
1	a film i expected very little from ,  and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be .  roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good' ,  it is funny throughout ,  the characters are endearing and the pace is just right .   toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt ,  said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams .  he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny .  watch out for these two .   highly recommended .
1	i lived during those times and i think the program caught the heart of the era .  i do think it should have dealt with more of the afro american issue but i think it cover a lot in the program .  it was scary to sit and watch the riots on t v hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down .  i thought jerry o'connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war .  i went to school with guys who came back .  some had changed more than others and some not so much .  it bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough .  live through it and then make comments .  i thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job .  thank you for a trip  ( sad and good )  down memory lane .
1	a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend .  of course the sob is very good-looking ,  charming ,  etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman .  watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends .  it's tragic ,  and you know she's going to end up very hurt ,  but there's nothing you can do .  leaud is brilliant .  totally empty .  a blank throughout ,  he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants .   the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love ,  and the next morning he puts on a record and ,  very sweetly and charmingly ,  sings along to amuse her is brilliant .  the  " what the hell am i doing here with this idiot "  expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come .   it's a long film ,  but see it in one go ,  preferably in a cinema .  takes a while to get into ,  but then the time just disappears .
1	since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed .  this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's tv series  " x-files " - but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach .  but don't get me wrong ,  some of these episodes have full on horror themes ,  many in which have some pretty greuesome plots  ( left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television )  .   some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting ,  but that is the charm and attraction to this series .  whether you like mystery crime dramas ,  comedies ,  or sci-fi/horror themes ,  this series brought all that together .  each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so  ( 1 hour with commercials )  and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more .  a great classic show that is underrated in my book !
1	i saw this film at amsterdam's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum ,  all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers .  the film's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right ,  making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent .  equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist .  his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving .  i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian .
0	yet another  " son who won't grow up "  flick ,  and just the other recent like entries .  heder in another bad wig ,  channeling napoleon for ,  what ,  the third time ?  anna faris is forgettable ,  as always ;  jeff daniels phoned this one in from another state ,  at least ;  and diane keaton .  .  . how does one become typecast this late in a career ?  do not bother .  nothing is said here that hasn't been covered many times over .  i will say this ;  it's about a hundred times better than  " failure to launch "  .  there are very few amusing bits in the movie ,  unless you think eli wallach cursing is funny .  ha ,  ha !  he's old and he dropped the f-bomb !  tee ,  hee ,  hee .  pitiful !
1	this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films .  it is another solid based-on-a-true store ,  which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes .  frankly ,  i don't know but i liked the story .   the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else ,  including his father ,  does in this west virginia town .  the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father ,  which i think was overdone .  i would like to have a little less tension between the two .   the young man ,  still a boy ,  is played by jake gyllenhaal ,  one of his first staring assignments ,  i think .  he's likable ,  as are his school buddies in here .  it's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film .  the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper  ( the dad )  and laura dern  ( the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time .  )   the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear .  once again :  i wish there more of these kind of films made today .
0	i found a dvd of  " i dream of jeanie "  in the $1 . 00 bin at wal-mart .  when i saw that it was the  " story of stephen foster "  ,  being a musician and music educator ,  i had to see it .  i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover ,  just that it was a remake of 1939's  " sewanee river "  .  bill shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful ,  sometimes laughable .  the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through !  i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs .  .  . without paying him for them !  in addition to that ridiculous notion ,  there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray middleton and his black-faced  " christy minstrels "  performing stephen foster's songs that was difficult to watch ,  to say the least .  i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time .  it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten .  fortunately ,  stephen foster's songs will never be forgotten .  .  .  . also ,  eileen christy's portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history .
0	come on ,  what is the deal with this show ,  power rangers anyways ?  i always felt that the show ,  which was originally brought over from japan in a better form ,  took what was great in japan ,  and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history !  there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever .   the bad haircuts ,  bad costumes ,  earrings ,  etc ,  all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots ,  bulk and skull ,  to the  " duhs "  ,  of the main cast ,  jason ,  trini ,  tommy ,  kimberly ,  billy and zack ,  i just want to say one thing :  give me a break !   saban brought this from japan ,  and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago .   now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such .   all i can say once again is give me a break !
0	this film was hard to get a hold of ,  and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming .  i mean ,  this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century :  an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt .  with all of this built-in interest ,  how could anyone make such a lackluster ,  talk-laden flick of this true-life event .  while williams is always interesting ,  the screenwriters assumed that the d . b .  cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star ,  s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off .  harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty ,  but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction .  shame on this film for even existing .
1	although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie ,  i am ashamed to say i rather like it .  not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham !  video ,  so it is most definitely worth a viewing  ( £0 . 79 a night in my local store !  )  .  watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume ,  the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following :  evil wizard-type bloke :   " at last we meet kor .  .  .  "  kor :   " thrilling ,  isn't it ?  "   amazing !  ! i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety  ( among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film ,  none of them actually happen .  no ,  i'm not joking .  .  . there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird ,  it's just trying to make you interested .  .  . classic in my opinion .  this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value !  !
1	 " scoop "  is also the name of a late-thirties evelyn waugh novel ,  and woody allen's new movie ,  though set today ,  has a nostalgic charm and simplicity .  it hasn't the depth of characterization ,  intense performances ,  suspense or shocking final frisson of allen's penultimate effort  " match point ,  "   ( argued by many ,  including this reviewer ,  to be a strong return to form )  but  " scoop "  does closely resemble allen's last outing in its focus on english aristocrats ,  posh london flats ,  murder ,  and detection .  this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy ,  and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian ,  a magician called sid waterman ,  stage moniker the great splendini ,  who counters some snobs' probing with ,   " i used to be of the hebrew persuasion ,  but as i got older ,  i converted to narcissism .  "  following a revelation in the midst of splendini's standard dematerializing act ,  with scarlett johansson  ( as sondra pransky )  the audience volunteer ,  the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalist's post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story .  on the edge of the styx joe strombel  ( ian mcshane )  has just met the shade of one lord lyman's son's secretary ,  who says she was poisoned ,  and she's told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman  ( hugh jackman )  was the tarot card murderer ,  a london serial killer .  sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths .  with sid's deadpan wit and sondra's bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracy .   woody isn't pawing his young heroine muse -- as in  " match point ,  "  johansson again -- as in the past .  this time moreover scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star .  she's morphed surprisingly into a klutzy ,  bespectacled but still pretty coed .  sid and sondra have no flirtation ,  which is a great relief .  they simply team up ,  more or less politely ,  to carry out strombel's wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt .  with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondra's dad .  sondra ,  who's captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool ,  re-christens herself jade spence .  mr .  spence ,  i . e .  ,  woody ,  keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks ,  but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker ,  spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining ,  apparently with success ,  that he's in oil and precious metals ,  just as  " jade "  has told him to say .   that's about all there is to it ,  or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome .  at first allen's decision to make johansson a gauche ,  naively plainspoken ,  and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision .  but johansson ,  who has pluck and panache as an actress ,  miraculously manages to carry it off ,  helped by jackman ,  an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable ,  if he desires her .  the film actually creates a sense of relationships ,  to make up for it limited range of characters :  sid and sondra spar in a friendly way ,  and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though it's artificial and tainted  ( she is ,  after all ,  going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac )  .   what palls a bit is allen's again drooling over english wealth and class ,  things his brooklyn background seems to have left him ,  despite all his celebrity ,  with a irresistible hankering for .  jackman is an impressive fellow ,  glamorous and dashing .  his parents were english .  but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia  (  " x-man's "  wolverine )  really pass as an aristocrat ?  only in the movies ,  perhaps  ( here and in  " kate and leopold "  )  .   this isn't as strong a film as  " match point ,  "  but to say it's a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong .  it has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a tv show ,  but woody's jokes are far funnier and more original than you'll get in any such media affair ,  and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness .  it doesn't matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it's diverting summer entertainment .  on a hot day you don't want a heavy meal .  the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment ,  without crude jokes or bombastic effects ;  without vince vaughan or owen wilson .  critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded  " match point .  "  don't believe them .  he doesn't try too hard .  why should he ?  he may be 70 ,  but verbally ,  he's still light on his feet .  and his body moves pretty fast too .
1	a double life has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons :  the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role  ( here othello )  as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life ;  and that this is the film that won ronald colman the academy award  ( as well as the golden globe )  as best actor .  let's take the second point first .   is anthony john colman's greatest role ,  or even his signature role ?  i have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles .  most of his career ,  ronald colman played decent gentlemen ,  frequently in dangerous or atypical situations .  he is bulldog drummond  ( cleaned up in the goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist )  fighting crime .  he is raffles ,  the great cricket player and even greater burglar ,  trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend's honor .  he is robert conway ,  the great imperial political figure ,  who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth ,  shangri-la .  he is dick heldar ,  manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist .  i can add sidney carton and rudolf rassendyll to this list .  but here he is not heroic .  in fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others .  it does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-social .   to me colman should have gotten the oscar for heldar ,  or carton ,  or conway - all more typical of his acting roles .  but the academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it's treasure to it's leading members .  colman's anthony john is a very good performance ,  and at one point truly scary .  when alone with signe hasso in her home ,  she at the top of a staircase and him at the base ,  they have an argument .  she demands that  " tony "  leave ,  saying she won't see him .  he stares at her ,  his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before ,  and he says ,   " oh ,  no you won't !  "  he starts moving upstairs ,  frightening hasso ,  and she runs into her room .  he stops himself and leaves .  it actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of hasso on stage ,  or of edmond o'brien ,  or his killing of shelley winters .  it showed his blind fury .  for that moment it was  ( to me )  an oscar-worthy performance .  but it is only that moment .  i'm glad he was recognized for the role ,  but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance .   his actual performance in the shakespearian role of othello is not great ,  but bearable .  too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style  ( one wonders if that was due to the coaching of walter hampden ,  who probably knew how to handle the role properly ,  or a reaction to it )  .  nowadays  " othello "  is played by an african american actor more frequently than a white one .  paul robeson's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place .  but the three best known movie performances of the part are those of colman ,  orson welles in his movie of othello ,  and laurence olivier in his movie of his play production of othello .  all three white actors did the role in black face .  my personal favorite of the three is welles ,  who seems the most subtle .  but even watching welles' fine film version makes me angry that robeson never got to put his performance  ( with jose ferrer as iago )  on film .   now the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role ?  i heard different things about this .  some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set .  others have found a role they have to be stimulating ,  influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life .  but actually i have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role .  it seems a melodramatic ,  hackneyed idea .   as a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with cukor ,  kanin ,  and gordon .  in 1944 a  " b "  feature ,  the brighton strangler ,  starring john loder ,  had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous  " jack the ripper "  type ,  and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind .  there was an earlier movie in the 1930s ,  in which an actor playing othello gets jealous of his wife  ( i think the title was men are not gods ,  but i'm not sure )  .  but due to colman's name and career ,  and cukor's directing ,  it is a double life that people think of when they recall this plot idea .  it even reached comedy  ( finally )  on an episode of cheers ,  where diane chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent ,  and they put on othello at the bar ,  just after he sees her with sam malone kissing .  only diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict ,  and can't delay the production long enough  ( she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play )  .    the cast of a double life was first rate ,  and cukor's direction was as sure as ever .  so the film is definitely worth watching .  but despite giving colman an interestingly different role ,  it was not his best work on the screen .
0	if there was a zero rating ,  i would give it to this movie .  today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldn't make it through from beginning to end .  i can't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise !  the acting is atrocious all around ,  the script is blah ,  the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened .  the  " southern "  accent from the actress playing amber's mom is laughable - i'm from georgia and have friends from texas - believe me nobody talks like that !  none of her emotions seemed real in any scene .  the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment .
0	rodney dangerfield is a great .  he has done a lot of great works .  but this one .  .  .  . is awful .  the whole plot is whack .  it could have been much better .  the jokes in the movie aren't funny .  .  .  . their stupid .  this was very not so hilarious .  he can do much better than this .
1	the kids i took to this movie loved it  ( four children ,  ages 9 to 12 years ;  they would have given it 10 stars )  .  emma roberts was adorable in the title role .   ( expect to see more of this next-generation roberts in the future .  )  after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears ,  lindsay lohan ,  and paris hilton ,  it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look like she worked the streets .  also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included tate donovan ,  rachel leigh cook ,  barry bostwick ,  and monica parker  ( with a cameo by bruce willis )  .  final takeaway :  cute film .    ( note :  i did not read the book series ,  so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone .  )
1	my name is domino harvery .  {edit *dizzying* chop} my--my--my name is domino harvey .  {cut ,  chop} my name is domino harvey .  {edit .  cut .  playback}  never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before .  by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy ,  flashy ,  dizzying editing technique .  if i have to choose between loving it and hating it ,  i'd say i love it .  it was borderline distracting at times ,  but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality  ( even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos )  .   this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy .  otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her ,  no matter how much she suffered .  we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke ,  rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez .  the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walken's tv production company  ( what is christopher walken doing in every film ,  by the way ?  )  .  i guess that is a clever film technique ,  because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv/reality show editing footage as he likes .  it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this point .   it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace ,  with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence .  there are some funny jokes ;  it's all very modern and surreal at the same time .  it's a mess ,  but it's a rather enjoyable mess .  it is ultimately flawed in so many ways  ( the actors try too hard to make their characters  " cool "  ,  for one )  but it works .  i give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film  but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well .   7 out of 10
0	lame ,  lame ,  lame !  !  !  a 90-minute cringe-fest that's 89 minutes too long .  a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility  ( an abandoned convent )  is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky ,  witless dialogue that's straining oh-so-hard to be hip .  mostly it's just embarrassing ,  and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat  ( a sample of this movie's dialogue :  after demonstrating her artillery ,  fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau's vigilante charactershe :  `any questions ? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck )  .  bad acting ,  idiotic ,  homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects ,  it looks like the director's watched `the evil dead' way too many times .    i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back .  what a turd .
0	writer/director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa .  he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks .  the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time ,  and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film .   unfortunately sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his  " backstage "  footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast  ( also on that reel )  that was seen by millions ,  not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies .  and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage ,  because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera ,  not faking footage .   finally ,  anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel's hacked-up version of it .   ( he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk's assassination than of his  " smoking gun "  .  )  sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it .  what's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use ,  such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth ,  destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth .   as with most films of this type ,  sibrel relies on innuendo ,  inexpert assumption ,  misleading commentary ,  and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence .
1	although too young to remember the first showing of the series  ( being just a baby )  i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's ,  just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects .  it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests ,  relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific .  since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era ,  with mixed opinions .  the british television stations are generally very good at producing these ,  as the world at war can easily attest ,  with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies .  i strongly recommend such titles as  " the nazis - a warning from history "  ,   " blitz "  and the bbc series about dunkirk .   " britain at war in colour "  ,  with its companion series  " japan "  ,   " germany "  and  " america "  are of a very high standard .  the world at war is by far the best and ,  despite its age ,  never fails to deliver .  there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other ,  even if such an undertaking was even possible .  what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable .  that certainly worked for me :  i now have a very comprehensive library of books ,  videos ,  dvds and tapes and cds .  recommend to anyone with even a passing interest .  the series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative .
1	although this was obviously a low-budget production ,  the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing .  one of walken's few musical roles to date .   ( he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel !  )  also starring jason connery .  a great children's story and very likable characters .
1	***spoilers*** seething with hatred and revenge half breed zach provo ,  james coburn ,  had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planing his escape .  what provo want's more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process ,  during a wild shootout ,  killed his navajo wife :  the former pima county sheriff sam burgade ,  charlton heston .   making his escape after killing two prison guards provo makes his way towards yuma knowing that that's not just where burgade lives but where his his young daughter susan ,  barbara hershey , resides as well .  using his fellow escaped convicts to lure burgade into the vast arizona desert ,  by promising them $30 , 000 . 00 in gold coins that he buried there ,  provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on burgade .  but only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are ,  in not being with a woman for years ,  as horny as a rabbit during mating season !   brutal and very effective western that updates the john wayne 1956 classic  " the searchers "  in a father searching through dangerous indian territory for his kidnapped daughter .  charlton heston as the guilt-ridden sam burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff .  charles coburn as the vengeful half breed zach provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict .   the man who escaped with provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice ,  in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand ,  but to go along with him .  it's only the thought of them having their way with susan ,  when provo gives them the green light ,  as well as the buried $30 , 000 . 00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way .   also going along with burgade is susan's boyfriend hal brickman ,  chris mitchum ,  who proves in the end that he's as good as burgade is ,  who felt that he just didn't have it in him ,  in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense ,  which in this case burgade lacks ,  in doing it .   ***spoilers**** the unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between burgade and provo is almost too much to sit through .  provo who's hatred of burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death .  it was that hatred that bugrade took advantage of and ,  after taking some half dozen bullets ,  thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty ,  as well as mindless ,  lunatic away for good !
1	i don't know why i picked this movie to watch ,  it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different .  every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero/thriller flick and this film certainly was different .  right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn't figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real .  i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end .  i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors .    at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being ,  and are left with the 'things are going to be ok' type of a feeling .  i'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance .
1	in a word - excellent .  this is the movie .  go and see it .  the director ron howard .  .  .  i mean ,  the director ron howard did a fantastic job ,  as he usually does .  an incredible attention to detail ,  vivid colors and decorations ,  breathtaking whoville atmosphere ,  astonishing variety of costumes .  wait ,  there's more to it than that - the story is very good ,  too .  there's clearly a message to be extracted from it by the thoughtful viewers .  jim carrey is top-notch .  he is probably the best grinch possible .  the girl ,  taylor momsen ,  is real good .  i'm sure she has some great future .  the dog is cool .  all in all ,  it's a very high quality christmas fairy-tale .  if you like fairy-tales ,  it's for you .  if you like christmas ,  it's for you .   reading some other reviews here .  .  .  get a life .  it hurts me every time to see people out there who .  .  .  well .  .  .  got their hearts two sizes too small .
1	so ,  every year there is at least one movie ,  that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success ,  because from the moment of production ,  even before one simple shot is filmed ,  everybody's picking on this movie .  .  .  there is a long list of these kind of movies ,  and in the end ,  some are really bad  ( battlefield earth  ( 2000 )  )  ,  some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable  ( catwoman  ( 2004 )  ,  elektra  ( 2005 )  )  and then there are a few ,  which actually are really great for what they are ,  but no one admits !  i mean ,  my gosh ,  just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on ,  not everybody has to join them .  so yeaaah ,  maybe those movies aren't perfect ,  but c'mon ,  how many movies are ?  not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings !  not everybody will enjoy these movies ,  but i bet there are more than who admit they do .  hudson hawk  ( 1991 )  ,  who is just hysterical funny ,  color of night  ( 1994 )  ,  which may not be oscar-worthy ,  but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists ,  swept away  ( 2002 )  ,  which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance ,  gigli  ( 2003 )  ,  which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former  " bennifer " -couple ,  and this year it's  " basic instinct 2 "  !  well ,  when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically ,  and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until i've finally seen this movie .  and really ,  i was very positively surprised !  i can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here .  it never simply copies the original ,  it has a quite clever story ,  has tension ,  action ,  humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life !  with 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s ,  but it's more than her being beautiful ,  it's brilliantly acted ,  with all her looks ,  her famous smile ,  the way she speaks and moves .  .  .  from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her .  it's simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell ,  and all of the other actors deliver solid performances ,  too !  so i really can't see what's wrong with this movie .  .  .  it has a dark ,  thrilling ,  sexy and gritty look ,  strong performances ,  and you never felt bored !  maybe the story isn't oscar-caliber ,  but it never even tries to be !  it's an entertainment-movie ,  and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion !  so give it a try !
1	as many reviewers here have noted ,  the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story .  i have never seen the stage version of the story ,  and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers .  perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film ,  but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas' show .  the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try-out group .  this way our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try-outs .  douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part .  apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one ,  and the backstage cliché-ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added .  i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film .  the repeated intrusions cassie made during try-outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and/or luck .  however ,  this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past ,  and it's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again .  the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the  " i can do that "  number ,  but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories .  frankly ,  their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this .  *** of 4 stars .
1	 " midnight cowboy "  is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in america .  its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial .  no wonder it was a huge success when initially released .  but be warned ,  its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made .  the characters are memorable ,  well-developed ,  and ultimately tragic .  the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending ,  something which was basically mandatory by the 80s .  still ,  this is why i treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for american film .  its a time when well-made ,  innovative ,  and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer .  all this was over by the time  " star wars "  was released .   the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work .  it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing .  unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects ,   " midnight cowboy "  has aged quite well .  its still as powerful now as it was when initially released .  the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece .  the characters' backgrounds are never fully explained ,  but the performances make them completely developed .  both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic  ( despite their sometimes reprehensible actions )  .  plus ,  being a fan of vintage exploitation films ,  i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street .   " midnight cowboy "  is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made .   ( 10/10 )
1	british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types :  the quiet ,  introspective ,  usually romantic study and the farcical social satire .  settings ,  characters ,  and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories .  butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type .    the scripts are very verbal ,  including long interior monologues by the main character ria ,  a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life .  when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman  ( who makes his interest in her quite clear )  ,  she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered .   the acting and scripts are always on the money ,  which makes one's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one :  i was neither blown away by it nor turned off .  my mother ,  on the other hand ,  adored this show .  i think the degree to which one identifies with ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies .
1	the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival ,  i thought it intriguing ,  fascinating ,  the sensitive bi-sexual artist .  so very european ,  so very dutch !  i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious-sexual orientation persecution complex .  get a grip !  this guy is a freeloader ,  living off of society .  i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy-nightmares about the  " spiderwoman "  is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year's of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars  ( and bed )  with strangers !  not only is he making outrageous sums of  ( probably taxfree )  loot for making up stories  ( lying guilt trip )  but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut ,  hence he hustles the beauty salon owner .  then he has the nerve to complain about the bill !  but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made .  on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont's camera work and one of paul verhoeven's earlier films .  hmmm ,  maybe the world hasn't changed so very much after all ?
1	despite the title ,  the sword bearer ,  and the dvd cover  ( action/herioc poses of the sword bearer )  this is not a super hero film .    ( minor spoilers )  it follows the tale of sasha ,  the sword bearer ,  who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm .  cool you say ,  but no ,  this is real life .  if you had this power as a child could you control it when ,  say ,  faced by a mad man ,  or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her .  and if you don't control it ,  how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 .   this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him .  wandering aimlessly after another killing  ( much like a bout de soufflé )  .  he then meet katya ,  and the pair fall instantly in love ,  providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways .  however ,  his past is still chasing him ,  in the form of two police officers .   that is essentially the story ,  and there is virtually no action on screen ,  though a lot if suggested .   i really like this movie .  unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films ,  we get very little back story ,  there is no bad guy  ( unless you count the sword bearer himself )  abut there is a lot of heart and good character development .   worth checking out if you can find it .
1	i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film .  if you sit close to the screen ,  you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures .  the detail ,  colors ,  and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story .  how they were able to pull off the shading ,  i will never know .  i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished .  based on this film ,  i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film .
0	the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel .   journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three  " london novels "  :   " absolute beginners "  ,   " city of spades "  and  " mr love and justice "  .  i have read all three .  the first two are excellent .  the last ,  perhaps an experiment that did not come off .  but mcinnes's work is highly acclaimed ;  and rightly so .  this musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one's mind being turned into a glitzy ,  badly-acted ,  soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london ,  and does nothing of the sort .   thank goodness colin mcinnes wasn't alive to witness it .
1	the 1930s .  classy ,  elegant adele  ( marvelously played with dignified resolve by debbie reynolds )  and batty ,  frumpy helen  ( the magnificent shelley winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache )  are the mothers of two killers .  they leave their seamy pasts in the midwest behind and move to hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets .  adele begins dating dashing millionaire lincoln palmer  ( the always fine dennis weaver )  .  on the other hand ,  religious fanatic helen soon sinks into despair and madness .   director curtis  (  " night tide ,  "   " ruby "  )  harrington ,  working from a crafty script by henry farrell  ( who wrote the book  " whatever happened to baby jane ?  "  was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for  " hush  .  .  .  hush ,  sweet charlotte "  )  ,  adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt ,  fear ,  repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok .  the super cast have a ball with their colorful roles :  michael macliammoir as a pompous elocution teacher ,  agnes moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist ,  yvette vickers as a snippy ,  overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star ,  logan ramsey as a snoopy detective ,  and timothy carey as a creepy bum .  an elaborate talent recital set piece with pamelyn ferdin  ( the voice of lucy in the  " peanuts "  tv cartoon specials )  serving as emcee and original  " friday the 13th "  victim robbi morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on mae west impression qualifies as a definite highlight .  david raskin's spooky score ,  a fantastic scene with reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant ,  the flavorsome depression-era period atmosphere ,  lucien ballard's handsome cinematography ,  and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective .  mgm presents this terrific gem on a nifty dvd doublebill with  " whoever slew auntie roo ?  ;  "  both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers .
0	ahh ,  the dull t . v .  shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70's to make equally dull t . v .  movies !  some examples would be riding with death ( the most hysterically cheesy of the lot )  ,  stranded in space ( confusing and uninteresting )  ,  san francisco international ( horribly dull and unbelievably confusing )  ,  and this turgid bit of quinn martin glamor .    shot in hawaii ( although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots )  ,  it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show .  the real problem is that you don ; 't like most of the characters ,  including the drab main character diamond head ,  who seemed half asleep for the entire movie ;  his boss 'aunt mary' ,  who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on ;  diamnd head's girlfriend/fellow agent ( hell ,  i can't even remember her name )  a skinny ,  wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting ;  and the singing sidekick zulu ( again ,  i can't remember his character's name ) who wasn't bad in small doses .  the most interesting person in the whole production was ian mcshane ,  who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops .  alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called 'chameleon' used to disguise himself were just laughable .  i have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a south american dictator cum american general .  nor do i care .  the plot simply wasn't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time ,  let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on .  just call this one - hawaii five no !
0	greetings again from the darkness .  what ever happened to the great barry levinson ?  he directed two of my all-time favorites in  " avalon "  and  " diner "  .  he had some fine movies as well  (  " rainman "  )  ,  but always provided something of interest  .  .  .  until now .  i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring .   " envy "  is the definition of boring .  never of big fan of pure slap stick  (  " dumb and dumber "  )  ,  i was just stunned at how god-awful this movie is .  there are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long .  the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone sound-alike .  if the film had been written as well as the song ,  it would have been tolerable .  rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy  ( even julianne moore )  ,  but the real world exposes one weaknesses .  snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess .  the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller .  the first work commute together flashes some promise ,  but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script .  this script is like most of jack black's character's ideas - not a bad thought ,  but no hope for success .
1	spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence .  in an early episode of cartoon  " family guy "  the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there .  way back in 1949 however ,  the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea .   after a child's prank ,  the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure .  at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy .  withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain ,  the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state .   based at a time when rationing was still in operation ,  this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring .  featuring performances by stanley holloway ,  betty warren ,  philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey ,  the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation .  these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines .  feeling remarkably fresh ,  despite being over 50 years old ,  the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained .   ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence .  with films like  " passport to pimlico "  it's not difficult to see why .  amusing from start to finish ,  the story is always fun and always worth watching .
1	henry fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed abraham lincoln was like .  it is a fooler .  through fonda's performance we are led to believe  ( on the surface )  that abraham lincoln was a country bumpkin .  but ,  through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings ,  you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him .    in this movie henry fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor .  it is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years .  when he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect .  there is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard .  he shows this gift again in the lady eve in 1940 .   the ending by john ford is absolutely brilliant with henry fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the civil war .  he goes forward into history .  the movie is fiction but the insight into lincoln is tremendous .  definitely worth seeing again .
0	 " gone with the wind "  is one of the most overrated movies in history .  it is a film loved by mothers ,  grandmothers ,  and shut-ins who go to the movies once every five years .  as a zombie movie ,  it blows .  there isn't a shambling corpse in sight ,  and it's terribly light in the gore department .   " zombie 3 "  ,  on the other hand ,  is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore ,  it is better than  " gone with the wind "  .  it is also not overrated .  most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish .  it is ,  however ,  not boring rubbish .  after a terrorist steals a virus ,  he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter ,  and the chemicals leak into the ground .  the terrorist ,  who has been exposed to the nasty concoction ,  hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh-eating zombie .  one of his first victim's is a cleaning lady .  once she's bitten ,  lucio fulci's brand of hell breaks loose .  as usual for a fulci flick ,  the acting is atrocious ,  the storyline is riddled with plot holes ,  and the gore is plentiful .  turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei ,  so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature .  it is badly shot ,  too ,  poorly edited ,  and the sound design is flat .  still ,  it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing .  definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest .  or don't like  " gone with the wind "  ,  undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time .
0	first of all .  .  .  .  .   what the hell ?  why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing ,  offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch .    what the crap is funny about a dog being injured ,  a grandma getting her head knocked off .  .  . a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom ?  what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick .  anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny ,  should not even be allowed to walk the earth .    but from what i hear its not even offensive .  .  . so .  .  . they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage .  .  . and they cant even pull that off .
0	well ,  this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated .  i thought it would be more 'adult oriented' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-disney channel type mode ,  especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long .  alana de la garza is gorgeous but has a really fake italian accent .  the movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget .  there was one very cute moment which i'll just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner .  the laughs are very few and far between .  the end surprise for  " mr .  fix it "  is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else .  might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or tv but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie .
1	lost ,  probably the best t . v series ever made .  the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode ,  100 more are raised .  if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever .  the survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island ,  a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own .  after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting ?  and heres your answer ,  every season so far has always been full of surprises ,  your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time ,  very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully so far !  the series just sucks you in ,  it's chilling and very addictive ,  everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story .  lost is simply unbelievable ,  amazing ,  highly entertaining ,  top notch ,  t . v at it's best . how ever you want to put it .    lost beat's all other show's by a landslide .  and if your hating or criticising lost you don't know how to watch t . v or watch drama .  lost simply doesn't disappoint ,  you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better .  but it does !  it just keep's on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off .   " every thing happens for a reason .  "  and that is truly shown in the series .  eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up .  you will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on .    the 10 minutes of excitement :  you see something you didn't see coming ,  something major has happened to character or on the island .  there's hope somewhere .  you see a major twist that can or will change everything .  you hear your thought's churn ,  you wonder what's gonna happen next .  your heart beating .  the 30 minutes of brilliance :  you see a flawless scenes ,  tension building ,  you hear wonderful music by michael giacchino .  you see great flash backs ,  impressive acting .  you see wittiness ,  chilling atmosphere ,  which then get's converted back into tension .   everyone has there show that they are addicted too ,  that they can't get enough of ,  that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode ,  that they talk about 24/7 .  too me and many others it's this series .  lost .  once you start watching ,  you won't get enough .  the creators did a flawless job .  lost is completely unique and original ,  you won't see anything like it .  the clever idea of  " flashbacks and flashforwards "  and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts .  would they ever make a series like  " lost "  ?  something so interesting and something you will always remember .  it simply has stunned the world when it hit t . v .  a new generation of dramatic/sci-fi .  a instant classic before it reached out to the viewers .   i'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews ,  and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it ,  so what's stopping you from watching ?   every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better ,  you get more interested as it goes along ,  you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off .  the characters start to become very likable ,  and if your the critic type you would love to see lost in further detail ,  things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the island .  all together it's a great drama and a flawless series .  i guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far .  .  .  .  . so if you don't watch lost ,  read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind .  seeing is believing ,  so until you start watching you will never know  . i strongly recommend this masterpiece of series :  lost !  !  start watching !  !  !  you have not seen nothing until you watch lost !  !  !
1	as i said in my comment about the first part :  these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess .   the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization ,  but the aftermath ,  thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans ,  protected by only one powerful spaceship .   but when battlestar pegasus appears ,  the story heats up ,  carrying the battle back to the cylon planets .  okay ,  it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth ,  but it works for me .  it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects  ( even though those tend to repeat themselves ,  to say the least  : - )   )  .   i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board .  instead ,  we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen .  .  .   so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 ,  but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978 .
0	what made the french connection work so well was the relationship between doyle  ( hackman )  and russo  ( scheider )  .  in this catastrophe directed by frankenheimer  ( who also brought us such gems as raindeer games and the island of dr .  moreau )  the movie focuses on doyle and his singular obsession of capturing charnier  ( rey )  .  the fictitious idea that the nypd would allow doyle to travel to marseilles to find charnier with the help of the french local authorities is laugh out loud funny .  correct me if i'm wrong ,  but didn't charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack !  !  !  a street value of 32 million but yeah ,  let's send doyle to find this guy ,  it was his pinch after all .  please !  !  !  the story was weak .  the acting was terrible  ( with the lone exception of hackman ,  who completely overplayed his part )  .  the direction was all over the place .  even the cuts between scenes were terrible .  do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one .
1	the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein ;  and there's a very good reason for that ,  but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions ,  and the invisible ray is certainly one of them .  the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before  ( even way back in 1936 )  but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director lambert hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film .  the plot focuses on the good hearted dr janos rukh ;  a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth .  his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it .  however ,  tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element ;  which makes him glow in the dark ,  and also sends him mad .  .  .   the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - boris karloff and bela lugosi ,  and both give excellent performances .  karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with .  bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in ,  and it's a great performance from him also ;  it's nice to see a bit of versatility from lugosi .  the film does get off to a rather slow start ;  but things soon start to pick up .  the second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine  ( literally )  .  the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting ;  and it does work very well .  the film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely .  overall ,  the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties ;  but it's a very good one and comes recommended .
0	really ,  i can't believe that i spent $5 on this movie .  i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad .  it had zombies in it right ?  was i wrong !  to be honest the movie had it's moments .  .  . i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it .  overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again .  the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that .  buyer beware .  .  . unless you are into masochism .
1	pushing daisies was a wonderful show .  much like dead like me and wonderfalls ,  you can tell was created by bryan fuller .  i can understand how people who don't have much of a love for theater ,  cinema ,  musicals and the like would be annoyed .  this is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some .  these people seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy .  this program explodes with color ,  winks at old movie scenes ,  hums with incredible music and talented performances .  there is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to leitmotif .  the story takes many twists and turns but all very accessible because the conversations are about love ,  honesty ,  courage ,  loss and so many other things we face every day .  the only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and that was rushed because pushing daisies was canceled .  don't approach this as a typical tv show .  think of it as an evening at the theater ,  then sit back and enjoy !
0	i've been using imdb for a few years now ,  but have never written any reviews before .  however ,  this movie so disappointed me  ( even with a modest score of 6 . 4 at the time of writing )  that i couldn't keep quiet anymore .   noise is the story of a new yorker  ( tim robbins ) who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante ,   " the rectifier "  ,  and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding .   i take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer .  although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned ,  the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms .  car alarms ,  car alarms ,  car alarms .  there is really no other focus .  when the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms ,  it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of robbins' character .    yes ,  we're all annoyed by noise .  nobody likes the sound of car alarms .  of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle ,  and this movie uses that fact ,  and pretty much that fact alone ,  to sell this movie .  i say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship  ( including a completely needless threesome )  which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie .  honestly ,  it's eye-rolling .   robbin's character ,  very shortly into the movie ,  becomes completely unrelatable .  it seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore ,  and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity .  the first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry ,  car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy ,  the rectifier .  however .  .  .  the transformation doesn't take place .  he just renames himself .   i could go on for a while .  annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie ,  and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves robbins face doesn't help either .    overall ,  i think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be ,  as it's pretty much shoved down your throat ,  but in my opinion ,  it fails in a big way .  just one guy's opinion ,  cheers .
0	twenty years ago ,  the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later .  on the present days ,  michael  ( gordon currie )  invites his girlfriend peg  ( stacy grant )  and his best friends chris  ( myc agnew )  ,  jennifer  ( emmanuelle vaugier )  ,  lisa ann  ( kelly benson )  ,  ned  ( brendon beiser )  ,  mitch maldive  ( phillip rhys )  and trish  ( rachel hayward )  to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm .  he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear ,  and together with his indian friend crow  ( byron chief moon )  ,  they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty  ( jon fedele )  that would eliminate their fears forever .  the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father ,  but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father ,  killing his friends .    " the fear :  resurrection "  is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows ,  but in a messy screenplay full of clichés .  there are some exaggerated performances ,  like for example ms .  betsy palmer ;  others very weak ,  but in general the acting is good .  unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live ;  further ,  in spite of being surrounded by close friends ,  the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies .  the low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation .  in the very end ,  michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story .  i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with 87 minutes running time .  the special effects are very reasonable for a b-movie .  my vote is four .   title  ( brazil )  :   " fear 2 :  uma noite de halloween "   (  " fear 2 :  one night of halloween "  )
0	no cinematic achievements here ,  however that's not even the important question .  how does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie--and star vehicle ?   the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston--check ;  there's a built-in tv audience !   add thick-headed ,  compliant men ,  usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fiancée--check .    assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars .  so far ,  so good .   what is the male lead to consist of ?  he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience  ( and the gay flight stewards )  instantly swoon .  but .  .  . he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience ,  and he can't outshine the star .  roll cameras .  .  .   the problem is messing thinks she's still in a sitcom .  .  . she has only one presentation :  as the wide-eyed doormat that she's made a career out of .  a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene ,  where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds .    you can't help feeling good for mulroney .  .  . you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this .  he's gotten all the respect of a lifetime  . 260 hitter .  this time ,  he smacks one out to the warning track ,  and no one can figure out what to do ,  as he amusedly takes home plate .
1	i have to agree with most of the other posts .  was it a comedy ?  a drama ?  to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side .  i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived .  jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name .  in new york ,  how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland . and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold .  again ,  a comedy or drama ?  but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning .  i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance ,  she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously .  she is a younger actress that is going to be viable .
1	the bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow-haze of socio-introspection emerged ,  inspiring such famed derivatives as cop land ,  the departed ,  the godfather 3 ,  and most recently of course ,  the wire .   with multi-faceted characters and story lines that have been described as '4-dimensional shakespeare' ,  the bill grabbed you by the collars from episode one and just would not let you go .   the show covered ,  anticipated ,  and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010 .  the most famously prescient moment being episode 19 of series 5 ,  which aired on the eve of the second gulf war .  detective jim carver's misguided - and ultimately career ending - drugs raid on craig 'fun boy' richardson's flat in the jasmine allen estate in early 2003 ,  was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of iraq several months later .   however ,  it was the work the bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser-known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise .  this was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet-phobia ,  under-uniform cross-dressing ,  in-van homosexuality ,  lost truncheons ,  casual drunken bestiality  ( regretted )  ,  siren aversion syndrome  ( sas )  ,  groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many ,  many more issues that still trouble ,  disturb ,  haunt and excite officers to this day .   the last word should go to one of the bill's most famous fans ,  nelson mandela :   " it is no exaggeration to say that i would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on robben island if it wasn't for the heart-warming ,  casual buffoonery of reg hollis .

1	i have a feeling that the warners bros depression-era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years .  yes ,  we are in the economic doldrums  ( or have you been living under a rock )  and times look bleak .  but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles .  in the 30's ,  film-going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom .   " footlight parade  ( 1933 )  "  was one such film that audiences flocked to .  while this lloyd bacon-directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as  " gold diggers of 1933  ( 1933 )  "  does ,  it's still a wonderful showcase of talent .  we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers ,  but boy ,  are they worth waiting for me .  yes ,  little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress ,  and her tapping is so-so ,  but busby's magical  " by a waterfall "  whisks her ,  and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls ,  into a dizzying water wonderland .  of course busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage  ( they defy limits of gravity ,  for one thing )  ,  and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough ,  wisecracking non-musical scenes .  and  " footlight "  also has james cagney in at the one of his all-too-few musicals  ( really ,  what couldn't this man do ?  )  .  he even gets to take over from the leading man ,  don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil  ( who is really little ruby in china-girl wig !  )  . he co-stars with joan blondell ,  his adorable ,  adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women  ( until the final reel ,  that is )  .  apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife .  and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene .
0	for some reason ,  tv guide gave this two and a half stars ,  plus faye dunaway is in it ,  so it definitely looked like something to see .  my ,  oh ,  my ,  this may be the worst film i've ever seen .  ever .  from its horrid acting  ( every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him ,  i shouted to the tv  " i can't act !  "  when she asks what he needs ,  i yell  " i need acting lessons !  "  to the unbelievably bad dialog  (  " give me back my organs !  "  )  .   and the brian depalma wannabe ending ,  too ,  it was all just beyond awful .  i wanted to like it .  dunaway is one of the best actors ever .  and the production values were pretty good .   but wowzers ,  this had me laughing ,  laughing !  ,  most of the time .   don't even bother out of curiosity ,  that was my first mistake .  staying with it was definitely my second ,  and third and fourth .
0	as an army veteran ,  i was deeply offended by this film .  in my opinion ,  it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war .  to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement .  if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon  ( it was )  ,  it would have been better received .  but it was taken seriously my many people ,  especially overseas .  silly as it sounds ,  wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film .  unrealistic ?  hmm ,  let's see .  a monosyllabic ,  muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow's .  in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats .  and he never misses ,  running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm .  i could go on ,  but i'm getting a headache .  i gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii .
0	 .  .  . is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire :  scandal ,  sex ,  celebrity ,  power .  kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks she's in  " legally blonde .  "  the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him .  eddie izzard is pretty good ,  except that he's playing charlie chaplin ,  and is about ,  oh ,  125 lbs too heavy for the part ?  hard to believe this hamfisted ,  uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich ,  but then again ,  he hasn't made a watchable movie in ,  what ?  30 years ?  sometimes ,  there's just no coming back .
0	for months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media ,  so i patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about .  after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the vcr for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie .  it essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters .  with the possible exception of amanda peet  ( whose only redeemable quality is that she is amanda peet )  you cannot stand any of them .  the film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric ,  moronic ,  and crude .  the only slightly amusing character is eric ,  whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on .  the final twist ,  designed to make you laugh at the three main characters ,  only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards peet .  all in all ,  only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor .
1	shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time .  the language somehow breaks the time barrier .  but perhaps it is the actors who really do that .   after the disappointment in romeo and juliet  ( the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio )  ,  was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare .  to my surprise othello was great !   iago's character was played so well by the kenneth fellow !  even thoough iago is really evil and despicable ,  the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be ,  a pleasure for the audience to hate .  i have to say that fishburne's performance here was really good as well .   i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students  ( who refuse to read the book )  alike .
1	this final entry in george lucas's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot .  however ,  this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series .  on the contrary .  sure ,  it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times ,  but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission .   the first third of the movie ,  where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt ,  is a classic .  jabba ,  a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language ,  not only makes a great villain ,  but a memorable one ,  too .  it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet ,  much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product .  actually ,  what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba's court ,  including the intimidating ,  slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster .  it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while .   things get a little bit slower around the second act ,  where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor ,  home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks .  most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures ,  in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga .  i don't totally agree with that ,  although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should .  however ,  their leader ,  wicket  ( played by warrick davis )  is a delightfully memorable creation ,  and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple ,  natural weapons provides a nice contrast .   by the time we get to the third act ,  though ,  the pace picks up again ,  as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops ,  lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire's all-new half-completed death star ,  and luke's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor .  the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie .  mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes ,  and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance .  also ,  as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is ,  he is rivaled only by the shriveled ,  crone-like emperor ,  played with deliciously raspy ,  frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid .  the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment ,  which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored .   the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects ,  and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors .  the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always ,  and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout .  of course ,  given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back ,  it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence .  the acting is classic star wars fare ;  hamill ,  harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles ,  and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c-3po .  frank oz's yoda only appears in two scenes ,  but he makes the most of it .  and yes ,  there's also john williams' music .   all told ,  while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle ,  the first and third acts deliver in style ,  making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever .   in 1997 ,  george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored  ( and revamped )   " special editions "  ,  which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements .  of the three ,  return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans .  perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place  ( albeit funny if you're not so easily offended )   " jedi rocks "  musical number in jabba's palace ,  which ,  although technically amazing ,  does disrupt the flow of the film .  however ,  i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy .  this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes  ( notably on naboo ,  where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming ,   " wesa free !  "  )  ,  and ,  in what is probably the most controversial change ,  hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes .  probably due to the intense  ( and unfair )  disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii :  attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone .  however ,  if you're watching the star wars saga chronologically  ( and contemplating about it )  ,  chances are you may react a little differently .  nonetheless ,  it is an issue that fans have raised ,  so it's probably best to be warned beforehand .   as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films ,  he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the  " definitive "  editions of his classic trilogy ,  and ,  when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga  ( as lucas intended )  ,  it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent .  the original films will always be engraved in our memories ,  but these new incarnations are just as much fun ,  if one can give them a chance .
0	this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever ,  i emphasize ,  ever made .  what´s worse ,  my old hero dolph is in it and he´s starring it .  jesus .  .  .  the story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt .  the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter .  the actors ,  except for dolph who kinda sucks also ,  perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director ,  who by the way must have been absent most ,  if not all ,  of the time .  this is §12 million spent in an unimaginable way ,  because by the look of the effects and scenery ,  the cost can´t be a cent above §1000 .
1	in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective .  one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography ,  is coup de torchon ,  the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine .  claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine ,  the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects .   i was struck with the dignity of potee ,  with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses .  i was also struck with the love/hate relationship between him and aimee .  it is the latter that gives the film its driving force ,  it is the latter that links this movie to indochine .   one never is sure what motivates everyone ,  though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism .  it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon .  theirs is the more scandalous story ,  perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way ,  but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships .   the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa .  he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother .  he was coming home ,  but they just thought him to be a little daft .  france ,  the character and the girl ,  grew up in cameroon ,  but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was .
0	on the way back from imc6  ( san jose ,  california )  ,  all five  ( mind you ,  three of us hardcore kamal fans )  of us had reached a unanimous verdict ;  vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday .  not to mention ,  we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year .   i won't blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan  ( on vijay tv )  .  he said something like ,   " tamizh cinema'la photography ,  editing'la namba munnera'na maadri screenplay ,  direction ,  acting'la innum namba munnera'la "   ( tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing ,  but we have hardly improved ,  when it comes to screenplay ,  direction and acting "  )  .  while you're watching vv ,  those words ring very true .   now ,  here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie :   1 .  harris jeyaraj  2 .  harris jeyaraj  3 .  harris jeyaraj i'm barely holding myself from using expletives here ,  but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his  ( remember 'anniyan' ,  'ghajini' )  with the jarring cacophony ,  he bills as background music .  the next time i have an eardrum transplant ,  he's paying for it .    4 .  songs neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice .  the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them .   5 .  a short gone too far .  vv at best is fit to be a short story ,  not a 2 hour plus  " thriller "  .  to use a cliché here ,  like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on ;  only in this case you don't want it to .  the later part of a movie feels like a big drag .   6 .  kamal-jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing .  there's no reason you would root for them to make it together .  in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie ,  they make a good irritant to the narration .  hate to say this ,  but kamalini mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus 'thenali' .   7 .  kamal haasan's accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us ;  and it isn't new either .  he's been doing it since 'thoongadae thambi thoongadae' .  it's simply gets on the nerve .  imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us .  he doesn't leave it at the immigration either ,  he offers doses of advice to his men  ( bewildered tn cops from keeranor ,  sathoor and beyond )  in chaste kamanglish  (  " wha we hav here is plain bad police wok "  )  ,  of course with nauseating effect .   8 .  logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale .  gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense .  which d . c . p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after !  the scene inside the theatre was so bad ,  towards the climax ;  we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero's iq .   " is he stupid ,  can't he just use his siren or lights ?  "   ( on a busy madras road ,  kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude !  )  .   " can't he just use his gun ?  "   (  " the guy on a bike "  starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time )  .  i'm not voting in favour of the later ,  but i'm just trying to explain the mood inside .   9 .  gore & violence if i wanted to watch women being raped ,  their throats getting slashed ,  more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity ,  i would sit at home and rather watch a  " police report "  or  " kuttram "  .  the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story ,  not overwhelm it !  somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions  ( rapes ,  murders )  are and what the mainstay  ( story )  is !   10 .  even a double shot espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head .
1	this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way .  dennis quaid and rachel griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives .    laced with dreams - dripping in reality ,  the american dream reignites after 9 . 11 with a true story about the devil ray's mid-life rookie ,  jimmy morris .  australian born actress ,  rachel griffiths ,  plays a native west texan better than a lot of texans i know ;  and dennis quaid was perfection  cast as the wannabe ,  gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience .  it's real .  the on-screen chemistry works .  if you like baseball heart-warmers ,  you're going to love this film .  the ingredients for americana and apple pie were all in there .  my popcorn became the a la mode' .    and hey :  buy the cd !  the music rocks and carries the story magnificently !  syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should ,  an area that disappoints me more often than not .   criticisms :  i'd have given the baseball to somebody else .  but quaid has something to teach us all about character' and heart .  st .  rita and the nuns were a nice decoration ,  but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them .  a little long .  worth every minute in the last analysis .  8 / 10 .
1	i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written-thank you peter hedges-and because when steve carell stars in the film ,  you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine ,  a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding .  dan in real life delivered that promise .   the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss .  with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche ,  their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys .  the cast ,  sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead .
0	i won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment .  i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled ,  let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma .  some scenes seemed promising ,  playing with visual dimensions ,  but couldn't hold up the rest .  i felt like i was stoned for the first time again ,  having semi-philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents .   what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights .  i'd rather watch jesus is een palestijn ,  without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor ,  also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves .   gert de graff is not jean-luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be .
1	this is an excellent movie .  it is about many things :  the hunt for a serial killer ,  the bureacracy of soviet russia ,  the drive of one man ,  and the relationship between this man  ( the lead detective )  and his superior .   the thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between durokov  ( rea )  and fetisov  ( sutherland )   ( excuse bad spelling ,  please !  )  .  for some reason ,  it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turning into respect and cameraderie and working together .  one line in the movie sums it up for me :   " he would say something witty ,  but he is overcome with emotion .  "   excellent acting by all of the cast ,  even the smallest parts were done with believability .   this is not a fast-paced action thriller ;  in fact ,  it moves at times like a slow drama ,  but it is worth it .  very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all .
1	this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor .  i don't see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor ,  i just don't think she did a very good job .  bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie .  they are going by train to davis's relatives house .  davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest .  but when they arrive home ,  their is a nazi living there and their's not much either can do about it .  it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas .  their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself .
0	elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community .  and while it was a very interesting idea in concept ,  in reality it has failed miserably .   the film is beautifully rendered ,  which is probably the only redeeming factor .  a huge problem with them ,  however ,  is the vast overruse of light bloom .  it's horrible ,  although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality .   one thing to note is the terrible voice acting .  while proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent ,  emo's voice actor is horrible .  i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero ,  you can't afford to hire real voice actors .  to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice .   as a whole ,  the movie doesn't really go anywhere .  to me it seems like it's more of a  " look what we can do "  kind of movie instead of a real film .  the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point .  the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas .   overall ,  it may be worth a quick download from the official site ,  but don't expect anything except pretty graphics .
0	there is a key aspect of film that jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you .  you don't need to tell the audience what to think ,  because they'll see it .  the action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former .  and it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals .  maybe jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support .  and he may have been right ,  it lacks a basic credibility :  70s edinburgh wasn't exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the velvet underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath .  from the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together ,  it's all too contrived for my taste .
0	i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family .  this movie could have been so much more .  the trouble ?  it was set during the big action movie craze .  i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing .  i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause .  yes it had funny scenes  ( or laughable )  though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes .  if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge .   i give this movie a low number .  it may not have been this low if i had not read the book .
0	a chemical spill is turning people into zombies .  it's up to two doctor's to survive the epidemic .  it's an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be .  bad acting ,  horribly awful special effects ,  and no budget to speak of .  the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement ,  much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb .  my original review of merely one word :  crap wouldn't fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is .  but i don't know if i can ,  so .  .  wait i think i may have enough words ,  or lines rather to make this review pass .  which is cool ,  i guess .  so in summation :  this movie sucks balls ,  don't watch it .   my grade :  f
1	since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english ,  i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing ( 2000 )  as presented in the bandai released dvd set .  my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of  "  " shin kidô senki gundam w "  ( 1995 )  .   very little is changed in respect to plot ,  script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in .  purists can stick to japanese all they want ,  but for a more  " realistic "  experience i recommend the english track since all the characters ,  except heero yuy ,  are not japanese .  ( most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non-japanese asians .  )  for one thing ,  the characters' personalities come across more  " directly "  than in the japanese version .  the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take performances but a very well cast group of actors .   wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity .  voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as  " bad acting "  but it matches heero's personality very well .   deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell ,  ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends .  he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show ,  masterfully played by scott mcneil .  he may sound a little too old for his age ,  but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one .   trowa ,  the pilot of heavyarms ,  is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat ;  despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him ,  he only knows how to kill ,  not to befriend .  kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton .   quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand .  a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl ( and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version )  but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy .   the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over-the-top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa .   relena darlian sounds older in english ,  voiced by lisa ann bailey .  this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story ,  her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development .   zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version .  both voices bring out different sides to the same character .  his japanese voice is haughty ,  authoritative and commands respect  ,  keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature .  his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued ,  sounding more devious and  " snake-like "  ,  highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals .   the members of oz are a mixed bag really .  treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life japanese style of speaking .  however ,  lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . bored most of the time .  the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either .   i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds .  the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents .  the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility .   despite underwhelming acting from the side characters ,  the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script .  very faithful to the original japanese script ,  keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics ,  war and human nature .  sadly ,  it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script .
0	i saw this movie ,  just now ,  not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in israel .  and to summarize everything right now ,  i will just say :  this is not a good film .   this is dror shaul's second feature film ,  and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made before this picture are much better .  further more ,  this is his first attempt at directing a drama .  the early works were comedies ,  and were funny and effective .   the first thing you have to know if you'll ever see this film :  israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of israel .  the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire ,  and some of them disappear one by one .  the kibbutz ,  hebrew word for collective ,  was a sort of village for members only ,  where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life .  with the change in social values with time ,  it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed ,  locked within the dogma rules ,  with no ticket out .  the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90's and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive .  the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that .   but ,  i regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz .  once ,  it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment .  but the film shows the opposite .  that the kibbutz ,  with it's socialist dogma ,  was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people ,  with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective .  this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism :  your individuality is the most important thing .  you must place yourself in the center ,  and no one else but you is the matter .  this is the philosophy the film stands for ,  and that's just it's first sin .   if you disagree with me on the political side ,  i'm sure you will agree that the acting ,  the tone of the film ,  it's script and it's direction are the four sins that follow .  the film has no real visual text and none of it's shots is something to remember .  it is also very  " delicate "  ,  a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions ,  which do not surface ,  not in the film and not with the viewer .  it brings nothing but boredom .   can someone please explain :  why this film won so many prizes ?  maybe because it shows that israel is in line with the rest of the world ,  hating socialist and human values ?  or maybe it shows that israel is a  " delicate "  place ,  not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism ?  that we are basically very human and good people ,  capable of emotions ,  especially when they are fake ones ,  just like capitalism expects us to be ?  or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years ,  a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the jewish state ?  no matter what the answer is ,  it's not a good one .  not for the world ,  not for human values and not for the jews .
0	the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality ,  psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history .  take a well-know genius you have not read ,  describe him as demented ,  include crazy physicians to cure him ,  a couple of somewhat good looking women ,  have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache ,  have every character speak with the strongest accent ,  show ridiculous dreams ,  include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one  ( freud )  ,  mention a few words used in the genius' works ,  overdo everything you can ,  particularly music ,  and you are done .  audience ,  please stay away .
1	i love this movie ,  but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid .   the fateful game took place in 1972 .  that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972 .  but almost all of the music played at the dances etc .  is from the 1950s and very early 1960s .   having just attended my 30th high school reunion ,  i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music .   i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically .  but it wasn't completely bereft ,  and the producers of the film should have taken more care .  i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film .   this was a bad director and/or producer decision .
0	this italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin .   the vhs box said it was rated  " r "  but the into on the actual tape inside said it was  " x .  "  the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking .  even in the dark ,  you could see dutch actress marishcka detmers performing all sex on this guy - and ,  yes ,  you could see his penis in her mouth .  i read somewhere that this was the first time where a  " mainline actress "  had done something like this on screen .   detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body .  she looked beautiful .  unfortunately ,  the movie is ugly .  .  .  . a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite detmers' looks .
0	this was the worst film i have seen for a long time .    not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies ,  the story is obvious ,  flat and absolutely not funny .    the girls are nice though ,  but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film .   this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad ,  made for an audience that is not older than 12 .   i never visited an american college ,  but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes .   save your time ,  do something else .
1	i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie ,  because i felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines .  the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written ,  but along the way ,  they run into the usual problems ,  including kermit's memory loss here .  while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original  " muppets movie ,  "  there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman .  simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great ,  and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious .  the original songs are also good here ,  and the ending is satisfying .  there is not much else to say about the film ,  but muppet fans should see it for sure .  it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all .   ***1/2 out of ****
0	this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced .  the insistent equation of jews with disease is simply  pathological ,  and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds  through its sheer repetition .  the fact that something this crude works ,  even  briefly ,  is an object lesson in itself .  you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this ,  and i wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason .
1	this documentary was interesting ,  but it was also long  ( so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes )  ,  like ben-hur long .  but if your into that ,  this is for you .  but only if you have a passion for movies ,  like i do .  being that martin scorsese is my favorite director  ( live and maybe even ever )  ,  this is quite fascinating ,  especially if you know the style of scorsese's works .  because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films .  not the best documentary film ever made ,  but it is a leap for scorsese ,  which is always good to watch .  a
1	it's a colorful slasher movie .  that's about it .   it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies ,  but i never care for such things .  figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway .   the death scenes were inventive and gorey ,  bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th .    another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl ,  unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious .    people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie .  as simple as that .  i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same .    --mb
1	stewart is a wyoming cattleman who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in utah ranch his only real companion is his sidekick ben tatum ,  the great walter brennan to accomplish that ,  they drive the cattle clear to alaska and on to dawson ,  in canadian territory ,  where they sell them .  .  .   along the way they meet the man who runs the gold-crazy town behind a dishonest lawman john mcintire .  .  .  he attempts to steal them the herd .  .  .  later ,  in dawson ,  mcintire and his gang reappear ,  this time interfering with stewart's gold claim .  .  .    captured by mann's camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian rockies ,  stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claims  in this entertaining ,  beautiful western ,  stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with :  ruth roman ,  a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman resisting the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more docile ,  the french canadian girl corinne calvet who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment .  .  .  in spontaneous manner ,  stewart is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wife-candidate .  .  .
1	i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own .  maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously .  i believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites ,  dust ,  squalor ,  selfishness ,  rudeness ,  malice and decay .  i'm giving all the credit to polanski's artistry in his direction ,  his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager .  luckily for me ,  my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this  ( so far )  but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the  ( fake )  reality he is trying to convey .  simply put ,  the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race .  this film is the sum of many ,  many instances of great acting and great casting .  as some performances were done in english  ( the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others )  and others in french  ( with most other characters )  and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french ,  i heartily recommend ,  if you happen to be bilingual ,  to switch the audio from french to english and vice-versa ,  during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd .  this film is part of polanski's so-called  " apartment building trilogy "  which also comprises  " repulsion "  and  " rosemary's baby "  .  unfortunately ,   " repulsion "  still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1 .  needless to say ,  the three films would make a magnificent boxset .
0	there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the 1977 toronto film festival .  it is dull ,  plodding and lacking in suspense .   peter oõtooleõs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright harold pinter are the only elements of interest .   note  :  some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson ,  best known for his portrayal of inspector japp in the poirot television series ,  in one of his earliest roles .  .  .  .
1	one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex yu . story is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same way . people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people . the plot is in the 50 "  , when josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence . but , in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything . the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from yu is still alive . they get together after all this years on ester " s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood , before their went to the emigration and become successful people .
0	let's face it ,  romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies  ( just look at the academy award nominations each year )  .  but still ,  the good ones are truly an art form .  look at  " when harry met sally "  ,   " sleepless in seattle "  ,  and classics like  " roman holiday "  and  " it happened one night "  .  i like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness .   this movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy .  but no one believes the romance between the main characters ,  and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming .  modine is way past being a leading man - especially a romantic lead .  i'm sure as executive producer ,  he had the means - but not the good sense - to cast himself .  and gershon .  .  . i see possibilities of some comedic talent ,  but she had no script and a poorly developed character .  and whose idea was the english accent ?  pointless .   others have stated it ,  but i want to repeat :  this story is poorly conceived ,  poorly executed ;  the actors are terribly miscast ;  and the characters ,  well ,  we just don't give a hoot about them .   an art form this ain't .  go rent  " moonstruck "  again .
0	i don't see what everyone liked about this movie .  the set-up was too long and talky ,  and when it was done ,  the main character remained as flat and opaque as he had been in the first scene .  after the film finally got cusack into the eponymous hotel room ,  i had to wonder ,  well ,  what's going to happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged .  the answer :  not much ,  just john cusack having a long ,  drawn-out ,  mental breakdown .   maybe if the cusack character had more depth  .   .  maybe if his freak-out were a more thorough reworking of his everyday life  .   .   .  maybe if the film had either better developed its half-baked themes about loss and faith or had not tacked them on in the first place  .   .   .  maybe if the film had made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrill-ride horror and had fully embraced one of these styles  .   .   .  i dunno .  all i do know is that i saw this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us much liked it .   except for the disquieting episode on the hotel ledge ,  the alarming crazy lady with the hammer ,  and the so-stupid-it-was-fun crypt keeper in the air duct ,  all three of which account for no more than five minutes of screen time ,  this film was a bore .   by the way ,  this story seems to steal ideas from the shining and use them here to much less powerful effect .  is stephen king now reduced to stealing ideas from himself ?
0	who me ?  no ,  i'm not kidding .  that's what it really says on the video case .   plot ;  short version :  pretty woman stands around smiling .  this ,  for some reason ,  makes all men kill each other .    " find ariel .  .  . where's ariel .  .  . can't find ariel .  .  .  "  she's right behind you ,  you idiot .  .  .   most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said ,  looks like .   a bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly .  then they get knocked off in the same way .  every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance .  perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check .  the alien virus/hologram/vr witch/glitch seems physically powerless and doesn't do a thing .  why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her  " teleporting vampire "  routine ?   ( actually ,  it would've been more interesting if she had been a vampire ,  or doing more than just standing around looking at people ,  which is all she ever does .  this is enough to make all the men kill each other .  go figure .  .  .  )   this isn't really a space flick .  there are far more shots of the old western trail ,  1950's easy rider trail ,  film noir's night club scene ,  even a jog on the beach in fantasy-land ,  none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense .  the night club scene is in black and white ,  of course .  worked with  " the wizard of oz "  .  doesn't work so well ,  here .  this is probably a good thing ,  as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly .  you will probably cry during those moments ,  especially upon seeing that swirling  " space ship "  ,  which looks about three inches long .   nothing is felt for any of the characters ,  not because they are convicts or have no personality ,  but because they are in serious need of acting lessons ,  except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss ,  probably by being in this work .  .  .   this is one of those movies that ,  when viewed with friends ,  is going to cause some extremely  " loud "  silences ,  especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one-liners  ( including the line about french-kissing a meteor .  .  .  ?  did i hear that right ?  perhaps not .  .  .  )   the original virtual reality girls get  " killed "  ,  which means nothing ,  as they are not even real to begin with .  well ,  the other  " characters "  aren't ,  either ,  but that's beside the point .  haha .   what's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull-horror-alien looking thing  ( green filter added on top of that ,  to give it more of a .  .  . uh .  .  . green look )  ,  which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot .   another odd deal i noticed .  whenever there is an explosion  ( at least on my cheap dvd copy )  ,  everything becomes highly pixelated .  i don't mean a little pixelated ,  i mean huge blocks about 1/16th the size of the screen .  wow .
1	this is definitely an appropriate update for the original ,  except that  " party on the left is now party on the right .  "  like the original ,  this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty .  it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous ,  and over-powerful federal government .  kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge ,  where the us government ,  with the cooperation of the mainstream media ,  threw around words like  " white supremacist "  and  " right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights ,  with the willing acquiescence of the general populace .  that message is so non-pc ,  i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick ,  katherine prudhomme ,  the western journalism center ,  and countless others who dared to speak out .   " live free or die "  is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays  " the voice ,  "  and that sums up the dangerous  ( to some )  message of this film .
0	i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week ,  and i'm still working off the trauma .  essentially my view seems to match a number of others - the first half hour was fresh ,  sharp ,  deep ,  entertaining and promising .  well acted too .  natural .  my problem ,  however ,  is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning ,  nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp ,  grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken ,  toothless ,  bread-chewing hags .  it's rather with the fact that they never warned me !  !  !  the festival brochure synopsis described only the  ( utterly intriguing-sounding )  first half hour - a whore ,  piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar ,  pretending to be an advertising agent ,  genetic engineer ,  and petty government administration official ,  respectively - making no mention whatsoever of the never-ending gum-smacking to come .  serves me right for not reading the reviews ,  you might say - but to my defense ,  a number of reviews i looked at post-fact um didn't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film .   the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director  ( a bashful ,  tousle-haired russian youth )  who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium  ( the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically ,  and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening ,  though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come ,  judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour ,  and many exasperated comments on exit )  to say the following :  'well ,  i .  .  .  um ,  thank you very much for coming to see this film ,  and i just wanted to say .  .  .  well ,  it's a very long film .  .  .  it took me four years to make it ,  and .  .  .  it's .  .  i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it .  it is very long .  thank you for coming . ' this is what he said .  alarm bells should have been ringing .  'what's he talking about ? ' i thought in happy confusion .  'this is gonna be fun ! ' of course ,  by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me ,  it was far too late to get out .  all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again .  and in the end i can't say i feel in any way improved by the experience .  yes ,  i absolutely loved the first half hour .  it was intelligent ,  new ,  and had a lot to say .  and yes ,  russia is probably in a bad state .  yes ,  every society has many hidden faces .  yes ,  toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard .  yes yes yes .  i get all of this .  really i do .  but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out ,  and so painful to bear .  if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging ,  try the korean-chinese bin jip  ( 3-iron )  .  it's artsy and surprising ,  but also to-the-point and fun .
1	i've seen this film on sky cinema not too long ago .  .  i must admit ,  it was a really good western which features 2 of the big names .  .  on one side ,  there's charlton heston ,  playing the infamous and retired lawman samuel burgade .  on the other .  .  the late james coburn playing the villainous zach provo .  .  seeking revenge on burgade no matter what the cost .  .  !   the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters .  .  most of the actors played it out really well .  .  especially james coburn ,  who i find that he was really mean in this film .  .  but that how it was .  .   christopher mitchum ,  who i've seen everywhere in other films .  .  playing hal brickman .  .  i felt his character was left out in the cold ,  but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with burgade ,  to bring down provo's posse's !   all in all ,  it was a great film .  .  very good to watch .  .  great score from the late jerry goldsmith .  .   wonderful piece of western persona .  .  !  8 out of 10 .
0	the dvd version consists of 2 episodes ,  the parricide of caesar being the juncture .  in addition ,  the language was spanish without subtitles .  hence ,  it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said .   cleopatra being an historic icon ,  the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer ,  leonor varela just plays fine .  she is strong-willed but also a very supportive ,  tender soul mate .  thimothy dalton as caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode .  so ,  it is not really a documentary ,  nor a peplum but a great love story .   after the parricide ,  a new lover comes  ( marc-antoine )  but the flavor is gone :  we remember always our first love .  so ,  i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully .   nonetheless ,  the production is luxurious :  the sets are big ,  tastefully decorated ;  the moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid .  the producers have a lot of money for sure ,  but they spend nothing on the special effects .  they are so poor  ( blue screens ,  ships ,  sphinx )  that it's funny .   finally ,  i would like very much to hear it in french or english to make a definitive opinion about this two movies .
0	i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me .  i have seen most of kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable .  alive ,  like all of his films has an interesting plot ,  some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity .  however ,  these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive .  the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film .  unfortunately ,  the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going ,  before reaching fairly predictable places .  the action is just about passable ,  with the final fight pretty cool ,  and the earlier one about ok .  the earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera-work ,  making for less coherency .  there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly .  the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring .  the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest ,  perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it .  with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller .  but the full length film is dull .  only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fans .
0	for all of the hype about this film ,  i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think .  and ,  although a bit slow at times ,  the first 90% of the movie is quite good ,  with more than a few  " old time "  scares that make one jumpy and unsettled .  i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes .  where dark remains fails ,  however ,  is in its climax .  the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body .  the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and ,  the answer i was seeking most - what really happened to emma ?  - was not elucidated upon !  the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best ,  and in the end ,  i felt very cheated .  what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending .
1	i am a fan of animal movies .  if you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over .  homeward bound did just this .  they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it .  it was a complete success .  it is very much an archetypal movie .  you have the obi-wan of the group ( shadow )  who is wise and logical ,  you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting chance ,  and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised .  these three personalities bounce off of each other very well .  i also like how they made chance and sassy such dynamic characters ,  and they did not overdue it .  most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film .  what they are forgetting ,  however ,  is that it is supposed to be a kids film ,  and this still does not take away from the acual movie .  this is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie .  it is a disney movie without the cartoons ,  an air bud movie with a better plot .  i would ,  without a doubt ,  advise you to watch it .
0	a difficult film to categorize .  i was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters & what their roles were .  nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows ,  not acted out .   this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show ,  with a largely insignificant sub plot going on ,  which just seemed to get in the way .  however as any irwin show is always worth a watch ,  this film is well worth a look too ,  but not on christmas day .  talking of which ,  i've better things to do too than be on here .   a high 4/10
1	i thought it was an original story ,  very nicely told .  i think all you people are expecting too much .  i mean .  .  . it's just a made for television movie !  what are you expecting ?  some great wonderful dramtic piece ?  i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie .  .  .  . and that's my opinion .
1	ok ,  first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was 9 years old .  if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time ,  i´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-tv horror film with some well-made scenes .  but when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts .  this scared the hell out of me back then ,  especially those aforementioned zelda- scenes  ( and they still do )  .  nowadays i´m kind of hooked to this film .  i have to see this maybe once in a month ,  and on every new year´s eve i watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends .  it´s like an appetizer for a good party !  i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense .  midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like ,  but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two .  hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which  " the creeds "  underact .  what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary ,  and i don´t mean the zombie stuff here .  the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind .  honestly ,  how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-tv one ,  but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there ?  alright i busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago ,  but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection .  but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary !  i really would love to know .  .  . and i don´t mean night of the living dead here .  .  . this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff .
0	if you like films that are totally bizarre ,  then this one is for you !  abdullah is one mean mother ,  with a passion for strangling people and eating ham .  you should check this film out ,  just for a laugh .  it is a low budget sci-fi ,  musical ,  comedy ,  cannibalistic ,  classic .  if you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere ,  just for the sake of seeing the aliens ,  which are nothing more than little toy robots ,  but in my opinion are the films highlight .   " i'm the big meat eater ,  pass me
0	this thing was bad .  really bad .  i mean ,  low budget can sometimes be very inspiring ,  but not this .  the story was so off-the-shelf ,  the alien's behaviour so illogical ,  the characters so clichéed .  i found nothing good in it .  and i did try .
1	this film was just absolutly brilliant .  it actually made me think .  during the whole movie i was confused as hell .  i loved everything about it .  .  . it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird ,  it was hard not to love it .  all of the actors were phenominal ,  and no one could have done a better job .  .  . this is one of my favorites of the year .  .  . it deserves an ocar .
0	this movie has some of the most awesome cars i've ever seen in a movie ,  and definitely the hottest women ,  but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i've ever seen .   here is the plot ,  and if you read it with a little inflection ,  you have the acting as well .   beginning ,  bring in characters ,  hot woman singing  ( obvious lip sync )  .  music agent or producer comes in ,  thinks that she is awesome asks her to race .  she turns down ,  too many bad memories .  flash to war hero ,  back from war ,  has several fights ,  and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone .  drive off in fast exotic car .  brother races ,  then dies .  hero to avenge death ,  cut away to getting weapons from friend .   ( you have never seen this friend before or after ,  but seems to really care about him )  are you sure you want to do this ;  yes ;  i mean are you really sure ;  yes ,  give me weapons ;  are you really sure ;  yes ;  ok ,  i guess i can't talk you out of it ,  be careful man ,  i love you .   now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove .  finds woman ,  decides to rescue her ,  she drives off ,  and he doesn't finish killing his uncle .  now there will be a race to finish the movie .  oh yeah ,  need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter ,  but maybe it adds a little plot .  race is not even that exciting ,  of course it ends with two cars racing ,  and one that should win throws in a surprise ending .   ok ,  i just saved you $7 . 00 .  you can send all of your money to me ,  because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does .  don't get me wrong ,  the cars are awesome ,  and nadija is beautiful ,  but it is truly an awful movie .
1	i think this film has much to recommend it ,  particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr .  foxx .  although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very ,  very hard to follow in some cases ,  all in all ,  it makes for a nice time in front of the tube .
0	quite possibly the nicest woman in show business ,  and the sexiest ,  debbie gives another fine performance here .  although her work in american nightmare was far superior ,  she is still worth watching in this film .   the cast is filled with your typical melrose place types ,  chiseled features and seductive curves ,  that i had never seen before .  other than debbie ,  laura nativo was the only actress i had seen before ,  in the similar delta delta die .   the plot centers around a group of california arrogants who initiate poor naive debbie rochon into their clique .  they tell her that they have a murder club ,  and that she must kill someone to be accepted .  debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people ,  so she quickly kills a person ,  and now the group must decide what to do with her ,  after she fell for their joke .   violence :  $$$$$  ( plentiful !  debbie rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face .  gore hounds will surely enjoy !  )   nudity :  $$$$$  ( plentiful as well !  debbie rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no-name actresses and actors .  the pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked ;  man and woman alike .  julie strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes )  .   story :  $$  ( could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes .  i understand that b-rate films use nudity often ,  but this is borderline excessive )  .   acting :  $  ( the acting is sub standard to say the least .  rochon is always a treat ,  easily the best b-rate actress in the business today ,  but her character in american nightmare was superior .  danny wolske does a fine job as debbie's object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about )  .
1	so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it .  we would watch it all the time .  when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we'd watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa's magical toys .  i'm 21 now and i still love this movie ,  some old friends and i recently got together and watched it ,  we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little .  one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa's magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie .  this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe ,  no violence ,  no bad language ,  just lots of great songs and important lessons .
0	this movie was so bad i don't know whether to laugh or cry .  i had high hopes for horrorfest that year ,  which was also the first year i attended horrorfest ,  and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level .  mad kudos to the advertisers because i'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year .  the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones i've seen  ( the other ones i saw were unrest ,  dark ride ,  and reincarnation )  .  the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot ,  only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some 'coming of age' tale about a boy's transition into being a vampire .  which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film .  and to make the plot even more ridiculous ,  they add in a set of horny twins who can't wait to take a 'bite' out of one another ,  and some deadly creature locked in the basement ,  which if i had discovered what 'it' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film ,  i would have left the theater halfway into the movie .   complete waste of money and time .  cut forty minutes out of this film ,  and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this .  absolute rubbish !  so bad that two years later ,  i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies i've ever seen .  also ,  while you're reading this ,  steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future .  the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere .  horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who can't make it onto the big screen ,  and all the crap about 'stuff they don't show you in theaters' ,  they weren't referring to blood or guts ,  or horror .  .  . they were referring to the movies themselves .  because they're horrendous .  think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival ,  but for horror movies .   sorry for all the 'hate' ,  but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money .
0	not very impressed .  its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film ,  because there is almost no development in the plot .  everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry .  the acting seems very poor as well ,  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television .  although this is difficult to tell with the female role ,  yuwen ,  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin .  it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .    tian zhuangzhuang's film the 'blue kite' was a far better film .  but don't be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late '40s .  unlike the blue kite ,  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself ,  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' or 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .   if any film fits the description of 'overrated , ' this is it .  i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry .
0	first let me state that i do not believe in god  ( if you want to use the word atheist ,  fine ,  but i don't like that word since it describes what i'm not ,  not what i am )  but i hated this  " documentary .  "  the production values were damn near non existent ,  the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in brian flemming's insecurities .   the production values were terrible and brian flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best .  the narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot ,  and he didn't practice at all .  there were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie .  animation was also pretty damn bad .   the whole idea that jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars .  as i stated before ,  i do not believe in god ,  and i don't think that whether or not jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of god .  my personal view ,  jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiah's  ( look up apollonius of tiana )  and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death .  according to the wikipedia article on the historicity of jesus  ( and there's a good citation for this so it's garbage )   " virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that jesus was a jewish teacher from galilee who was regarded as a healer ,  was baptized by john the baptist ,  was accused of sedition against the roman empire ,  and on the orders of roman governor pontius pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion . [1] "  i was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director's insecurities than anything else .  i was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else .  the most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal .  he's not even coy about it .  the way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while i agree with the director partially ,  that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing ,  the way that flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch .  flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going ,  if he was more tactile with his interview .  instead he comes off aggressive with  " isn't it bad to teach kids this stuff .  "  the guy cuts the interview short and i mean ,  what did he expect ,  the principal to say  " oh yes ,  i see it is ,  i have seen the light ,  this will now be a secular school ?  "  it seems that flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood .  this isn't about the documentary ,  this is about flemming's insecurities ,  and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary .  flemming shows what he's really doing here ,  and that is the real downfall of this so-called documentary .
0	i guess i am coming late to the party .  i just saw this 1995 version of bye bye birdy on sky tv .  i didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when i turned it on .   i played albert a long time ago and i am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because i remembered it as being so much fun to do .  i was not impressed with this newer version .  it just wasn't enough fun .  it was not colorful .  it lacked the exuberance of youth .  the lighting was bad .  no one seemed to mention this fact .  this is not a moody musical ,  it is bright and up beat .  the lighting decision was a poor creative choice .   bye bye birdy is a farce ,  a comedy of errors .  i got no sense of that in this version .  the lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances .  the dance numbers seemed anemic as well .  we do have music videos these day .  at least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those ,  or how about some of the best of broadway .  the choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed .   although all the actors were supremely talented ,  there were some really bad casting choices .  vanessa williams is not latin ,  and with so many talented latin performers out there ,  wouldn't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of rosie .  vanessa is african american ,  lovely and talented ,  but bad casting .  jason alexander's effort was astounding ,  he always does intelligent work ,  but he just wasn't albert .  he was miscast and i think that is obvious to most people who see this version .   the medium of film is not the medium of stage .  there needs to be translation from one medium to another .  the exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be translated to film .  there is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed .  the spirit ,  the essence of the production must be brought forth .  to me the 1963 film production of bye bye birdy was bright and lively ,  while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers .  it turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people .
1	sunday july 16 ,  8 : 00pm the castro ,  san francisco   " as a southern colonel your make-up is very indiana "   the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years .  that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving ,  is often speculated .  considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into ,  this criticism would seem to have some validity .  as a comedienne however ,  her star shone very brightly .  left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand .  one of her better outings was king vidor's show people  ( 1928 )  ,  which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos .  this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars ,  davies and that notorious joe college wise-cracker ,  william haines .  rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson ,  who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama  ( and don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone !  )  with von stroheim ,  walsh and demille .  coincidentally ,  the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before  ( think of who worked there !  )  .   colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper  ( dell henderson )  drives his daughter peggy  ( davies )  from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies .  these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone  ( haines )  ,   "   a custard pie artist  "  who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance  ( watch for the bit with the noodle )  ,  and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture .  what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball ,  but a job is a job and billy convinces her  "   .   .  all the stars have to take it on the chin   "  .  at the preview ,  billy and peggy bump into  .  .  charlie chaplin ,  who asks for her autograph !  she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign .  chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed ,  so naturally ,  she faints .  it's so very funny ,  considering davies character isn't supposed to recognize this guy !  peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios ,  changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind .  davies does a wonderful send-up of a serious actress ,  with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips .  vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot  ( and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder ,  facing the camera !  )  that includes polly moran  ( who's also sensationally funny playing davies' maid )  ,  louella parsons  ( one of the friendly vampires )  ,  estelle taylor ,  claire windsor aileen pringle ,  the comedy duo of karl dane  ( with his arm in a sling )  and george k .  arthur  ( pretending he's stealing the silverware )  ,  leatrice joy  ( amused by arthur's antics )  ,  renee adoree ,  rod  ( eating and smoking )  la rocque ,  mae murray ,  john  ( in a robe )  gilbert  ( who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture )  ,  norma  ( eeeww !  )  talmadge  ( looking bitchy and aloof as usual )  and patricia dressed like marie antoinette ,  sandwiched between douglas fairbanks  ( as he does an amusing trick )  and william s .  hart  ( protecting her from doug )  .  billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming ,  with predictably nutty results .  vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy's current production .  also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick ,  sidney bracy as the dramatic director who can't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does ,  and paul ralli as andre ,  her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony .  when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it .   while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence ,  it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm ,  irving thalberg ,  and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent .  what a shame so much has been lost .  there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy  ( 1928 )  ,  vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year ,  languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed .
0	carnosaur 3 :  primal species  ( 1996 )  d :  jonathan winfrey .  scott valentine ,  janet gunn ,  rick dean ,  anthony peck ,  rodger halston ,  terri j .  vaughn ,  billy burnette .  why even bother reviewing this movie ?  another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal  ( and very fake-looking )  prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways .  the original was bad enough ,  the sequel was even worse .  this falls somewhere in between ,  though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur films .  rating :  2 out of 10 .  rated r for graphic violence and gore ,  grisly images ,  and profanity .
1	i've watched this movie a number of times ,  and found it to be very good .  this movie is also known as  " castle of terror "  ,   " coffin of terror "  ,  and  " dance macabre "  .  barbara steele ,  is her usual beautiful/creepy self .  george riviere ,  the male lead ,  does a good job with his role .  the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere ,  and there is a good deal of tension throughout .  the camera angles are good and the acting ,  for the most part ,  isn't bad .  this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening .  i have the dvd uncut version ,  which is far superior to the edited tv version .  grab some popcorn ,  turn out the lights ,  settle back and enjoy .  john r .  tracy
0	the robin cook novel  " coma "  had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 .  a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment  ,  but in the case of  " sphinx "  virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong .  this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances ,  stupid dialogue ,  unconvincing characters and leaden pacing .  the only reason it escapes a 1-out-of-10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself .  hard to believe franklin j .  schaffner  ( of  " patton "  and  " planet of the apes "  )  is the director behind this debacle .   pretty egyptologist erica baron  ( lesley anne-down )  is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abdu-hamdi  ( john gielgud )  .  hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge .  consequently ,  he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop .  the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica ,  for it could provide vital clues in locating seti i's long-lost tomb ,  a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 .  before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop ,  with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end .  afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen ,  erica attempts to track down the treasure .  she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties ,  none of whom are truly trustworthy .  for one there is yvon  ( maurice ronet )  ,  seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives ?  then there is akmed khazzan  ( frank langella )  ,  an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her .   the biggest problems with  " sphinx "  generally result from its total disregard for plausibility .  down couldn't be less convincing as a female egyptologist  one assumes she would be quite well-educated and resourceful ,  yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick .  on those rare occasions that she actually isn't running from a potential villain ,  she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a 4 , 000 year old tomb !  the plot twists are heavy-handed to say the least ,  mainly comprising of revelations and double-crosses that can be predicted well in advance .  one can't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare ,  because the pacing is awfully sluggish .  what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium .  a famous review of the movie declared :   " sphinx stinks !  "  never before has a 2-hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words .
1	i first saw a track from this dvd at a hifi show nov 2006 in london  (  i was not really into cream until now !  !  )  . it was through a high end arcam system , it sounded great with dts . i had to get this dvd and i'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever watched . the performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd . it does not matter what type of music you like , this one will definitely grow on you . it's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again . even new musicians don't cut the mustard these days ,  as these old rockers do .
1	once again ,  i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4 . 88 .  fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap  ( i mean horrible beyond belief )  but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good .  this movie is much better than i expected .  i found it very engaging ,  though it was obviously made by an amateur .    the direction is nothing special ,  but the story is intriguing with some good thrills .  i expected it to be more of a comedy ,  but i wasn't too disappointed .    for a thriller ,  this movie is surprisingly good-natured .  there's no bloody violence ,  no profanity ,  no nudity ,  no sex .  usually ,  these movies require all four of those elements .  the pg rating is well-deserved--not like  " sixteen candles "  where the  " f "  word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene .    i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more .  the film does tend to be plot-heavy ,  and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side .  instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them ,  we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors .  they end up kissing at the end ,  but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced .    " the dream machine "  is no gem ,  but it's good ,  clean entertainment .  it's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns ,  except for haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect .    my score :  7  ( out of 10 )
1	what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise ,  a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films .  so .  .  . could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated ?  ?  ?   " prison "  is the finnish director harlin's american debut ,  which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like  " die hard 2 "  ,   " cliffhanger "  and  " deep blue sea "  .  the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison ,  re-opened for the cause of over-population in other ,  more modern state penitentiaries .  inside the former execution dungeons ,  the restless spirit of the electric chair's last victim still dwells around .  the now promoted warden eaton sharpe  ( lane smith )  was there already 40 years ago ,  when this innocent man was put to death ,  and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial .  it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived .  viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past .    " prison "  contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the unbearably tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain !  unlike any other horror picture from that decade ,   " prison "  features an amazing sense of realism !  by this ,  i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls ,  of course ,  and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed .  .  .  even though these are genuinely unsettling as well .  the film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror .  the absolute best terror-moment  ( providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age )  focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire .  haunting !  !  the screenplay only suffers one flaw ,  but that's a common one .  .  . almost inevitable ,  i guess :  clichés !  the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding .  we've got the ugly ,  fat pervert with his 'cute' boy-toy ,  the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old 'n wise black con who serves a lifetime  ( did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman ?  )  don't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise ,  as there are so many other elements to admire .  the photography is dark and moist ,  the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class b-actors are excellent  ( the fans will recognize tom everett ,  tom 'tiny' lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder )  .  forget about wes craven's god-awful attempt  " shocker "  or the downright pathetic cheese-flick  " the chair "  .  this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down !  especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays  ( i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves ,  hobbits and other fairy creatures .  .  .  )  this true 80's horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd-release !
0	is it just me or is that kid really annoying ?   hideos sister ,  spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so .  as for him ,  well ,  i know he's a kid n all ,  but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree .  so far i'm only half way through ,  and am fascinated by the story ,  but the people in it ,  let it down ,  i just hope it gets better by the end ,  as i can't not know what it's all about .  although ,  some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook ,  indicate everything is backwards ,  i . e .  dog is god ,  live is evil etc .  .  .  just seems a little obvious at the moment ,  yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning ,   ( as yet anyway )  if my opinion changes at the end of the movie ,  i'll update this post ,  but if your reading this ,  then well .  .  .  .  .  .  see above statement .
1	one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly .  i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters .  the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families/siblings go through in life .  the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting .  also ,  although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to  ( i . e .  jewish/twins/family business )  the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it .  that made it very engaging .
1	anna  ( ursula andress )  is brought in as an official r . n .  by ex-lover benito varotto  ( duilio del prete )  ,  ostensibly to nurse an aging widower ,  count leonida bottacin  ( mario piso )  ,  back to health after a heart attack .  but benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen ,  including american entrepreneur mr .  kitch  ( jack palance )  ,  with ulterior motives ,  reflected by what anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the count .  he has a history of ,  well ,  liking women ,  and would be actually a bit more  " vulnerable "  as he is cured .  the bad guys get derailed as anna does not go along and grows closer to the count .  the ending might be said to be ironic ,  but it is probably better described as predictable .    but so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy ,  from start to finish ,  and oh how good .  there are many nude scenes ,  including ones of anna and jole ,  one of the malevolent heiresses ,  played by luciana paluzzi .  both ursula and luciana are noteworthy continental ex-bond women ,  and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers .  as she did in thunderball  ( remember fiona volpe )  ,  luciana plays a femme fatale ,  sort of ,  although less elegantly .   perhaps the best scene is anna's  ( slow )  complete strip and jump in bed with the young adone ,  the  " other patient "   ( who incredibly is resisting )  ,  in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot .  but even at this point she is already two-faced  ( for the better )  ,  for she has decided not to go along .  however ,  benito is more than a two-timer with women ,  having had lengthy flings in the past with both anna and jole ,  and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled  ( to put it mildly )  argument between him and jole .  this is a standing-up encounter in which luciana is down to black panties only .  another nice one is ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool .  the count is free ,  as the client ,  to put his hands wherever he wants to on ursula ,  and he takes advantage .  hey ,  somehow i've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions .  erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase .   " the sensuous nurse "  is compact ,  77 minutes ,  but it doesn't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption ,  start to finish .  definitely recommended .
1	cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams .  it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations ,  both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget .   there are many great laughs  ( even if the story is somewhat thin )  sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style .  a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses ,  which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience .  as he makes his exit ,  he assures the client  ( grant )  that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100 . 00 from the total .  .  . or at least $50 . 00 .  .  . but certainly $25 . 00 .  hilarious !
0	please ,  be warned :  this movie ,  though a pretty bad storyline ,  was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen .  .  . ever .  just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie .   so ,  it officially begins with a party .  just your average party but there's some guy there .  he's pretty into kate .  .  . if you know what i'm saying .  memorise his face ;  it'll help later .   so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney  ( didn't i say the plot was bad ?  )  and so takes the tube .  that's london underground at the middle of the night ,  but she's just stupid like that .  so the timetable says the next ,  and last ,  train will come in 7 minutes .  now kate ,  dumb party girl that she is ,  decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes .  typically ,  she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground .  alone .  well ,  almost .  .  .   so the movie just carries on from there .  blood ,  guts ,  limbs ,  even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body .   in short ,  it's a typical horror ;  pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick ,  weird psycho .  or as the case may have it ,  creep .   i'd say give it a go if you're into saw ,  hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us ,  scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much .
0	i had to stop watching this film  ( a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers )  twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns ,  not to mention that i was soon near tears over the $3 . 99 i had wasted at blockbuster .  joanna pacula's acting and her awfully rendered slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth .  i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many .  both breuer and nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents .  while we're on the topic of talent ,  breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe .  she clearly has not learned her craft .  in fact ,  she's really quite awful .  all the public scenes looked staged ,  with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best .  turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on .  don't rent this terrible movie .  you will be sorry you spent your money .
0	there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can't possibly name but a few :   bogart's character :  1 .  his name  whip mccord  ( too easy ,  so i'll leave it at that .  boy ,  it makes `humphrey' sound good .  )  2 .  his long ,  curly hair and silly sideburns .  3 .  his black bart get-up ,  complete with spurs !  4 .  not sure what shade of lipgloss they've got him wearing ,  but it ain't none too flattering .   cagney's character  ( jim kincaid  )  :  1 .  his lipstick doesn't do him any favors ,  either .  2 .  the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film !  could they not find a hat to fit him ?  even a little ?  !  !  ?  !  3 .  his pants are too tight in the rear .  4 .  he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times ,  if you know what i mean ,  and i think you do .   if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan ,  and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western ,  do yourself a favor and forget that thought .  even the horses look embarrassed !   ( that is ,  when they don't look bored .  )   in all fairness ,  i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre ,  but i've still seen much ,  much better than this .   on a comedy level ,  or as high camp ,  the oklahoma kid works .  otherwise ,  it's viewer beware .  therefore ,  see this only if a )  you must see every western out there b )  you are a true cagney or bogie completist c )  any of the above comments appeal to you .  woah .  .
0	i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules :  this movie is aweful !  from the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors .  i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination  ( can't extend flaps without engines )  .  the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity .  that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear .  the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed ,  the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off ,  thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air .  how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground ?  did they forget the spoilers ?  word to the director :  find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a  " plane "  movie .  sorry for the technical rant ,  but i give this movie 1/10 .
1	this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul .  what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character ,  who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative .  yea ,  though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death ,  he fears no evil .  a rod and staff are there to comfort him .  in the end ,  he is saved from the dregs of humanity .  at the bottom is fagin ,  the most wicked of the lot .  fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not once ,  but twice ,  yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price .  fagin is worse than bill sikes ,  because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers .  in the middle is oliver .  his innocence is unsullied ,  but untried as well .  the best is nancy .  lacking in judgment ,  she ignores bill sikes' violent nature out of her deep need for love .  yet unlike fagin ,  at the probable cost of her own life ,  she does repent of her sins by saving oliver from bill .  things are not as they seem .  in my opinion ,  this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unpredictability .  i would give this film a  " 10 ,  "  but its '70's made-for-tv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting .  overall ,  a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences .
0	this is one of the worst movies i've ever encountered ,  but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted .  .   as far as pure film-making technique goes ,  this director is competent .  he's held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera ,  but the actual editing ,  camera angles ,  camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional .  i've seen many movies where the  " directing "  was much worse .  at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there .  also ,  the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere .  there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera ,  and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go .  as far as artistic merit ,  there is none .  the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film .  this is pure trash .  .  .  total garbage .   the gore is decent for a film in this budget range .   ,  it's obviously fake but there's lot's of it ,  and it's very outlandish .  .   i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing .  this was a good idea  ( and it's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film )  .  .  .  unfortunately ,  it's overdone ,  especially towards the end .   it's really a terrible film ,  but i have to recommend it for it's camp value .  it's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category .
0	cheap and manipulative .  this film has no heart .   it's also got dire dialogue ,  unconvincing characters and a preposterous ,  or rather non-existent ,  story .  it just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion-afest !   and the hedgehog !  !  !  ! how many cheap shots can a film take ?  the hedgehog ,  by the way ,  gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety-minute cringe-athon .   if you have considered watching this film ,  don't .  i'm sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie .  it scores a big ,  fat zero with me .  strictly for sub-dogma knicker-wetters .  yawneroony !   still ,  if you liked dancing in the dark .  .  .
0	one of the those  " coming of age "  films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids .  this movie has neither .  it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristel's body double frolic with a dorky eric brown .  to make matters worse ,  the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny ,  sexy ,  or dramatic .  laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard .  ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double .  as the movie went on and on ,  i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp .  watch this to laugh at other people's stupidity ,  or for ed begley jr . 's committed performance ,  or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt .  but i can give you an idea of your lesson ,  stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle .
1	this film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid .  there is really not much i'd need or want to say here .  except maybe  " see this film "  and  " enjoy the excellent work by daniel and pascal "  ,  who carries you through this neat ,  funny and heartbreaking story about 'spending your eighth day' - your own day !    seeing this film made me think seriously about how i spend my eighth day = my life !  it appears ,  that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do .  either if it's pleasing a career or just consuming tv-shows and ballgames .  what we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference .  about taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - now !   ( on the eighth day )  .  .  .  at least that was what i got from 'the eighth day' .
0	a different look at horror .  the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting .  however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good .  the protagonist ,  marie played by anastasia hille wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her .  she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left .  also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film .  then a long time passed before any real suspense built up .  once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else .  the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot .  all in all i'd recommend it for renting ,  but not for theater goers .
0	this movie features an o . k .  score and a not bad performance by david muir as dr .  hackenstein .  the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the  " special effects "  that this is a low budget movie .  there is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist ,  horror/comedy ,  or low budget movies .  not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either .  this movie is simply here .  anne ramsey and phillis diller are nothing to get excited about as well .  if you are curious as i was and can actually find this ,  you will realize the truth of the one line summary .
1	moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family !   before the real story of the movie starts ,  we get a performance of the bad tour  ( man in the mirror )  ,  and it kicks off a great movie .  after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier ,  as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988 .  after a few music videos also  ( speed demon ,  leave me alone ,  etc .  )  the story starts .   the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends  ( who are kids )  are being chased by the bad guy of the story  " mr .  big "  ,  because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs .  during the chase we see fantastic segments ,  fx .  michaels video for smooth criminal ,  which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences ,  etc .  but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr .  big ,  and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict .   during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards ,  but also impressive today .  for instance ,  see michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends !  it's so cool !   the movie ends with a performance of come together  ( later published in michaels double-album of history )  ,  and you leave the movie with a magic feeling .  amazing !   i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv .  and now some parents might stand up and say :   " but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser !  "  yeah ,  he is indeed ,  but ,  come on ,  we all know it isn't true !  wait and see .  .
1	to some ,  this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation .  .  .  others see it as a story of grace ,  restoration ,  and hope .  .  .  it is actually both  henry king illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion ,  his downward spiral of sin ,  and his upward climb of healing .  .   'david and bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity .  .  .  henry king handles the powerful story ,  taken from the old testament ,  with skill .  .  .   david ,  'the lion of judah , ' having stormed the walls of rabgah ,  saves the life of one of his faithful warriors uriah  ( kieron moore )  ,  and returns to jerusalem .  .  .    back at his court ,  his first wife complains of neglect ,  and offends him for being a shepherd's son ,  distinguishing herself for being the daughter of king saul .  .  .   one evening ,  and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood ,  david's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath .  .  .  she was beautiful and attractive .  .  .  david could not take his eyes off her .  .  .  he finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers .  .  .    sending for her ,  he discovers that she ,  too ,  is unhappy in her marriage .  .  .  by this point ,  it's apparent that david's intentions shift from an interest in taking bathsheba as a wife ,  to just plain taking bathsheba .  .  .  as usual ,  sin had its consequences ,  and david hadn't planned on that possibility .  .  .   when a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine ,  david suspects that the lord is punishing him and his people for his sin .  .  .  but when bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of moses ,  david tries to cover up his sin .  .  .    he sends word to joab ,  the commander of his army ,  and ordered him to send to him bathsheba's husband .  .  .  david did something that was abominable in god's sight .  .  .  he sends the man to the front line where he would be killed .  .  .    the soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way ,  david marries his beloved bathsheba in full regal splendor .  .  .   god punishes the couple when bathsheba's child dies soon after birth .  .  .  meanwhile ,  a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the israelites - led by nathan - blame the king for their plight .  .  .  they storm the palace and demand that bathsheba pays for her sin .  .  .   peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity .  .    hayward as bathsheba ,  is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery .  .  .  the sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in biblical film history ,  is badly mishandled ,  and the viewers eyes are led briefly to hayward's face and shoulders .  .  .   raymond massey appeared as nathan the prophet ,  sent by god to rebuke david after his adultery with bathsheba ;  gwyneth verdon is queen michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to david's personality and kingship ;  ex-silent screen idol ,  francis x .  bushman ,  had a brief part as king saul .  .  .    the best moments of the film were :  the ark en route to its permanent home when god breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object ;  the defining moment in david's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death ;  and for the film's climax ,  inserting it as a flashback ,  david remembering his fight with the giant goliath .  .  .    with superb color photography and a masterly music score ,  'david and bathsheba' won oscar nominations in the following categories :  music scoring ,  art and set direction ,  cinematography ,  story and screenplay ,  and costume design .  .
1	again ,  it seems totally illogical ,  to me at least ,  that  " arthur "  merits a mere 6 . 4 out of 10 possible .  steve gordon's one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally  " unlikely "  if not quite  " impossible "  melding of wildly disparate elements .  that he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is ,  in itself ,  wonderful .  that he gave dudley moore his finest role ,  and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact ,  including the score ,  seems to me patent and egregious .  i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud .  but ,  apparently ,  nearly a third of its audience has so managed .  well ,  i ,  for one ,  found and find gordon's effort both laughable and lovable ,  and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald's great-aunt and stephen elliott's murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters .  even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization ,  and the late ,  sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee ,  but wrong about undertaking his role .   " arthur "  makes no effort to  " underztand ,  "  much less rationalize ,  the scourge of  " alcoholism "   ( hey ,  ifit ain't booze ,  it's other drugs of choice ,  including meth ,  and addictions are merely symptoms ,  not targets )  ,  it simply observes in its own quizzical manner .
1	it's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent ,  stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves .  they should make this the official and only true real hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh's  " hamlet "  .   it's a perfect ,  complete version of the play ,  potent ,  massive ,  earthshaking first-class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of .  they've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career .  every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction .   the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses .  branagh is phenomenal in the leading role .  his sharp ,  irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history .  every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end .  branagh's version of  " hamlet "  is among the ten best motion pictures ever .
1	this little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites .  i can watch it over and over .  dreyfus and braga are masterful ,  but raul julia steals the show !  a tongue-in-cheek ,  menacingly humorous gomez addams ,  with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told story .   generally untrumpeted and unappreciated ,  moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen .  two thumbs up !
1	escaping the life of being pimped by her father (  .  . and the speakeasy waitressing ) who dies in an explosion ,  lily powers ( barbara stanwyck ,  who is simply ravishing ) sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city gotham .  when a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law ( and lily's new lover )  ,  the sky's the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands .  newly appointed president to the bank ,  courtland trenholm ( george brent )  ,  sends lily to paris instead of forking over lots of dough ,  but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the city of love .  this makes lily's mouth water as now she'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way .  though ,  circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches .  . trenholm ,  now her husband ,  is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank .  he needs money lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing .   stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish .  being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy .  good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act .  obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of lily's dead heart .  that ending having lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn't ring true to me .  she's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him .
0	what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way ?  this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches :  unctuous priests ,  spitting before handshakes ,  town square cattle marts ,  cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music .  quickly ,  however ,  it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy-o of irish cliches - religous strife .  it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic-fathered child is educated ,  which would seem like a reasonable enough wish ,  though not to the '50's county wexford villagers she has to live with .  rather than send them to a catholic school ,  she decides to up and leave for belfast ,  then scotland ,  where a few more cliches are reguritated .  while she's there ,  her father  ( who looks eerily like george lucas )  and family back home are subjected to a boycott ,  which turns very nasty .  i'm not going to give away the ending ,  not because i think people should go see this movie ,  but because it's not very interesting .  one of the problems with the film is the central character :  we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life .  the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to ,  but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it .  in addition ,  it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process :  the woman is told by her lawyer that she  " must lay down preconditions "  for her return .  the film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively ,  and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches ,  in the past .
0	and i thought the beach was bad ,  with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time ,  nicolas cage .  don't blame him for the awful script ,  if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie ,  give your self a pat on the back .  its a cross between the village and a crappier script .  its starts off kinda catching your eye ,  and then as it goes further into the plot ,  it just makes no sense ,  and don't get me started about the ending !  !  !  !  what was that ?  the only thing that makes this movie exist is nicolas cage usual great humor ,  and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations .  if you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch ,  save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why ,  just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind ,  and there you go !
0	just a dumb old movie .  first stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way ,  and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way .  in an effort to save him ,  stanwyck gets unlucky ,  yet again ,  and comes across an escaped convict .  she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way .  in the end her husband is saved ,  and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is .  all's well than ends dumb .   i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywood's glamour-oriented golden era ;  that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short ,  running a little over an hour .  it's as though the director sensed that he was making crap ,  so he thought it best to keep the crap short .
0	i wanted to punch the tv .  watching it was torture .  i hated it .  never watch this movie .  the terrorists are annoying .  adam sandler is annoying .  i normally like him but not in this one .  i wanted to break the dvd .  this is the most irritating film in the world .  the comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious .  the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls .  it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv .  do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone .  if you even like adam sandler a little bit ,  don't buy it .  it will just make you hate him .  do yourself a favor ,  if you see it in the store ,  hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it .  its a waste of the $1 . 99 i paid for it .
0	acting is horrible .  this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning film .  they throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story .  there is a reason why people on the internet aren't even downloading this movie .  this movie sunk like an iron turd .  do not waste your time renting or even downloading it .  this film is and always will be a perma-turd .  i am now dumber for having watched it .  in fact this title should be referred to as a  " perma-turd "  from now on .  calling it a film is a travesty and insult .  abhorrent ,  abominable ,  appalling ,  awful ,  beastly ,  cruel ,  detestable ,  disagreeable ,  disgusting ,  dreadful ,  eerie ,  execrable ,  fairy ,  fearful ,  frightful ,  ghastly ,  grim ,  grisly ,  gruesome ,  heinous ,  hideous ,  horrendous ,  horrid ,  loathsome ,  lousy ,  lurid ,  mean ,  nasty ,  obnoxious ,  offensive ,  repellent ,  repulsive ,  revolting ,  scandalous ,  scary ,  shameful ,  shocking ,  sickie ,  terrible ,  terrifying ,  ungodly ,  unholy ,  unkind
0	i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again .   i have seen action films ,  i have even liked quite a few of them ,  but this one goes over the top .   not only does it have the worst male actor ever  ( sly stallone )  playing the lead role ,  but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning  ( why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground ,  would be hell of a lot easier )  that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it .    furthermore ,  the plot has no real twists at all ,  a three year old kid could guess what comes next .  it is a set of cliches  ( of action genre )  ,  with sly performing even worse than his other movies  ( he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film )  .  now there is an actor who can't act a )  surprised b )  sad c )  anything else than his basic face .    i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it .  explosions are outstanding ,  but then .  .  .  you can see better on the 4th of july .  landscapes are magnificient ,  but then .  .  .  there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas ,  so you can see better sights that way ,  rather than waste time on this flick .   go watch some other movie instead ,  there are hundreds ,  even thousands better action movies .
1	look ,  this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world .  to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself .  i remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty .  the economy was weak ,  communism threatened us all ,  and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty .  out of that confusion came a hero ,  stroker ace .  ned beatty's performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness .  his triumph is an inspiration to all .  the on-screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer .  jim nabors is a poet .  go see this movie tonight !
1	i saw the movie with two grown children .  although it was not as clever as shrek ,  i thought it was rather good .  in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break ,  there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it .  there parents also seemed engaged .  the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments .  hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids .  as such ,  it was successful although i liked it too .  personally i liked the scrat !  !
0	i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie !  the lines ,  pacing ,  and timing of events in that film are outstanding !  however ,  this european vacation sequel is a major let down .   in this sequel ,  the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show .  the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild ,   " ha-ha "  laughs .  for example ,  a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark ,   " do you want your coke in the can ?  "  clark answers back ,   " no ,  i'll have it right here .  "  that's really about the only line that is funny in this film .   european vacation's humor is strained .  as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie ,  tried to re-hash a script that had been done before ,  and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time .   worse ,  the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found .  their replacements are not funny ,  can't act ,  and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time .  there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny ,  they are in bad taste .   the griswald's should have stayed in wally world .  the place that made them legends !  don't join them on this european dreadful adventure .  viewers should re-watch the original vacation movie in place of this !  you'll be glad you did .
1	after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century ,  in 1908 playwright d . w .  griffith got the job that would make him a legend :  he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies .  it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business ,  but he accepted the job ,  and in less than a year he became biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative .  many years later ,  he would direct  " the birth of a nation "  in 1915 ,  the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors ;  however ,  a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career .  1909's  " the sealed room "  is one of those ,  and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century .    " the sealed room "  is a story set in the 16th century in which a count  ( arhtur v .  johnson )  has built a windowless room in his castle .  it is a small yet nice and very cozy room ,  as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife ,  the countess  ( marion leonard )  in a more private way .  however ,  the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful ,  as she is infatuated with the minstrel  ( henry b .  walthall )  at court ,  with whom she is having an affair .  as soon as the count gets busy with his own business ,  the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count's new room .  when the count returns ,  he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect ,  finally discovering the two lovers in his room ;  but instead of making a scene ,  he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife :  to seal the windowless room with the couple inside .   written by griffiths' regular collaborator frank e .  woods ,   " the sealed room "  takes elements from edgar allan poe's  " the cask of amontillado "  and mainly honoré de balzac's  " la grande breteche "  to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism .  despite having a runtime of 11 minutes ,  woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way ,  and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story .  while a melodrama at heart ,  woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era .   " the sealed room "  is definitely a very simple and basic story ,  but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith's melodramas .   in  " the sealed room "  ,  griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual .  while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience ,  in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror ,  playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had .  it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot ,  culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes .  not being a movie where camera tricks are essential ,  what shines the most in  " the sealed room "  is griffith's talent to direct his actors ,  as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day .   as usual ,  the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith ,  starting with arthur v .  johnson as the count .  johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster .  his performance is not without a touch of overacting ,  but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality .  as the countess ,  marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting ,  conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery .  finally ,  the legendary henry b .  walthall appears as the handsome minstrel ,  and while far from being one of his best performances ,  he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film .  while not of real importance to the plot ,  it's nice to see other members of griffith's stock company in the background ,  like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court .   while not exactly a masterpiece ,   " the sealed room "  is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days .  the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget ,  griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style .  the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era ,  and johnson's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch .  while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential  ( and controversial )   " the birth of a nation "  ,  the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend .  simple yet elegant ,   " the sealed room "  is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century .  7/10
0	i hated the way ms .  perez portrayed puerto ricans !  we are not all ghetto - and we do speak spanish- not puerto rican !  i can not speak for the uneducated persons you have run into .  but our language is intact ,  our island is our pride .  puerto rico is better off economically than any other caribbean island !  i'm glad we are not like cuba ,  dominican republic or haiti ,  free from american influence ?  free in true poverty ,  not the u . s .  standard of poverty .  we are not victims we are resilient ,  humble , honest and intelligent people .  our ancestry does include strong african roots ,  but not  " black "  roots- i have nothing in common with black americans 9do the research )  .   the analogy between pedro albizu ,  che guevarra and martin l .  king could not be more off the mark .   mlk was a great hero a true revolutionary- an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free .   che guevarra helped castro create the cuba that is today ,  is that why boat fulls of cubans risk their lives to come to america- because che made such a better place for them ?  you had a great ,  awesome ,  bright idea but you politicized it too much .  we have so many things to be proud of as a people - don't bring shame to our people by victimizing us .  i am not a nuyorican and perhaps that is why i can't share your views .  i am puerto rican ,  i speak spanish ,  i am not a victim and i have been able to accomplish many of my goals in america .  if there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph- there are many .   damaris maldonado
0	absolutely one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time !  it starts off badly and just deteriorates .  katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character .  the only cast-member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore ,  who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role .  the script is dire ,  the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through !  it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen !  katherine heigl's character is completely unsympathetic .  she's seen as an evil ,  wanton seductress who lures the poor ,  innocent married man to cheat on his wife .  it is implied throughout the movie that she's underage ,  and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief !  at the end ,  she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously  ( ha !  )  become demented with rage and guilt ,  but the script allows him to kill himself ,  thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere .  horrible .  don't waste your time .
